1
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:19,057
<i>Did you know there are more people
with genius /Qs living in China</i>

2
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:21,185
<i>than there are people of any kind
living in the United States?</i>

3
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:23,061
<i>- That can't possibly be true.
- Lt is.</i>

4
00:00:23,062 --> 00:00:24,188
<i>What would account for that?</i>

5
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:27,274
Well, first, an awful lot of people
live in China, but here's my question.

6
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:29,485
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people

7
00:00:29,486 --> 00:00:31,403
who all got 1600 on their SATs?

8
00:00:31,404 --> 00:00:33,280
- I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.

9
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:35,491
I wasn't talking about China any more,
I was talking about me.

10
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:37,034
You got a 1600?

11
00:00:37,035 --> 00:00:38,952
Yes. I could sing in an a cappella group,
but I can't sing.

12
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:40,245
Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong?

13
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:42,623
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

14
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:43,957
Or you could get into a final club.

15
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,584
Or I get into a final club.

16
00:00:45,585 --> 00:00:46,877
You know, from a woman's perspective,

17
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:48,837
sometimes not singing in
an a Cappella group is a good thing.

18
00:00:48,838 --> 00:00:49,963
This is serious.

19
00:00:49,964 --> 00:00:51,507
On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew.

20
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:53,675
Well, I can't do that.

21
00:00:53,676 --> 00:00:55,135
I was kidding.

22
00:00:55,136 --> 00:00:56,386
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

23
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:58,263
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

24
00:00:58,264 --> 00:01:00,182
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

25
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:02,518
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional?

26
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:04,561
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.

27
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:06,188
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.

28
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:08,190
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

29
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:09,316
No.

30
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:11,485
Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.

31
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:13,028
And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew

32
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:14,154
so I assumed you had met one.

33
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:18,700
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

34
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:20,202
<i>Okay-</i>

35
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:21,370
Should we get something to eat?

36
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:23,455
Would you like to talk
about something else?

37
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,750
No. It's just since the beginning of
the Conversation about finals club,

38
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:29,419
I think I may have missed a birthday.

39
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,673
There are really more people in China with
genius IQs than the entire population...

40
00:01:32,674 --> 00:01:36,093
The Phoenix is the most diverse.
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc.

41
00:01:36,094 --> 00:01:37,261
Which one?

42
00:01:37,262 --> 00:01:38,845
The Porcellian, the Porc.
It's the best of the best.

43
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:42,015
- Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore.

44
00:01:42,016 --> 00:01:44,101
Is it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls

45
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:45,644
who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?

46
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:48,438
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.

47
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,484
Okay, well, which is the
easiest to get into?

48
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:55,445
- Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.

49
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:57,698
None of them. That's the point.

50
00:01:57,699 --> 00:02:00,701
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer

51
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:02,119
and Eduardo won't come close to getting in.

52
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,162
The ability to make money doesn't
impress anybody around here.

53
00:02:04,163 --> 00:02:07,499
Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer?

54
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,918
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,212
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.

56
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:13,380
I think you asked me that

57
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:15,257
because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into

58
00:02:15,258 --> 00:02:16,592
is the one where I'll have the best chance.

59
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:19,011
I... What?

60
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:20,637
You asked me which one was
the easiest to get into

61
00:02:20,638 --> 00:02:23,223
because you think that that's the one
where I'll have the best chance.

62
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:25,809
The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one

63
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,060
where anybody has the best chance.

64
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:28,729
You didn't ask me which one
was the best one,

65
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,439
you asked me which one
was the easiest one.

66
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,942
I was honestlyjust asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask.

67
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:36,862
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
- Enca.

68
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:38,822
You're obsessed with finals clubs.

69
00:02:38,823 --> 00:02:41,283
You have finals clubs OCD
and you need to see someone about it

70
00:02:41,284 --> 00:02:43,035
who will prescribe you
some sort of medication.

71
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:45,662
You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness.

72
00:02:45,663 --> 00:02:49,625
Final clubs. Not "finals clubs."

73
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:52,210
And there's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.

74
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:55,130
Yes. There is.

75
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:56,882
Well, you do.
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code.

76
00:02:56,883 --> 00:02:58,216
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

77
00:02:58,217 --> 00:03:00,052
I'm just saying I need to do
something substantial

78
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:01,970
in order to get the attention of the clubs.

79
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:04,473
- Why?
- Because they're exclusive.

80
00:03:04,474 --> 00:03:06,350
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

81
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:07,976
Teddy Roosevelt didn't
get elected president

82
00:03:07,977 --> 00:03:10,020
because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.

83
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:12,356
He was a member of the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.

84
00:03:12,357 --> 00:03:16,318
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,402
Did you really just say that?

86
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:18,987
I was kidding.

87
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:20,739
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.

88
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,907
I wanna try to be straightfon/vard with you

89
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:24,242
and tell you I think you might
want to be a little more supportive.

90
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:27,913
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings,

91
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:32,250
and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.

92
00:03:32,251 --> 00:03:34,336
You would do that for me?

93
00:03:34,337 --> 00:03:35,921
We're dating.

94
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:38,882
<i>Okay-</i>

95
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:40,550
Well, Iwanna try and be
straightfon/vard with you

96
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:42,427
and let you know that we're not any more.

97
00:03:42,428 --> 00:03:45,055
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating any more. I'm sorry.

98
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:47,182
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.

99
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:48,266
You're breaking up with me?

100
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:49,601
You're gonna introduce me to people

101
00:03:49,602 --> 00:03:51,395
I wouldn't normally
have the chance to meet?

102
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:53,271
What the... What is that supposed to mean?

103
00:03:53,272 --> 00:03:54,606
- Wait, settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?

104
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:56,566
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here
and drink right now

105
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:59,361
is 'cause you used to sleep
with the door guy.

106
00:03:59,362 --> 00:04:03,115
"The door guy"? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy.

107
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:07,619
The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people.

108
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,247
And what part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon?

109
00:04:10,248 --> 00:04:12,582
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm.

110
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,959
- Is this real?
- Yes.

111
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,086
- Then wait, I apologise, okay?
- I have to go study.

112
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:17,462
- Enca?
- Yes?

113
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:19,798
- I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study.

114
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,134
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk.

115
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:23,468
- I can't.
- Why?

116
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:26,471
Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster.

117
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:28,765
All I meant is that you're not likely to...
Currently...

118
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:29,975
I wasn't making a comment
on your appearance.

119
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:32,269
I was saying that you go to BU.
I was stating a fact, that's all,

120
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,395
and if it seemed rude, then I apologise.

121
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:34,813
- I have to go study.
- You don't have to study.

122
00:04:34,814 --> 00:04:36,231
Why do you keep saying
I don't have to study?

123
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:40,152
'Cause you go to BU.

124
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:42,320
Do you want to get some food?

125
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:45,615
I am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education.

126
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:47,284
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat,
so we're even.

127
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:50,120
- I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.

128
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:51,246
I was just being polite.

129
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:52,497
I have no intention
of being friends with you.

130
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:54,666
I'm under some pressure right now
from my OS class

131
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:57,627
and if we could just order some food,
I think we should...

132
00:04:57,628 --> 00:05:02,591
Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person.

133
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:05,177
But you're gonna go through life
thinking that girls don't like you

134
00:05:05,178 --> 00:05:07,596
because you're a nerd.

135
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:12,017
And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true.

136
00:05:12,018 --> 00:05:17,018
It'll be because you're an asshole.

137
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,870
<i>Erica Albright's a bitch.</i>

138
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:21,498
<i>Do you think that's because her family
changed their name from Albrecht,</i>

139
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:26,499
<i>or do you think it's because
all BU girls are bitches?</i>

140
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:31,216
<i>For the record, she may look like a 34C,</i>

141
00:08:31,217 --> 00:08:33,927
<i>but she's getting all kinds of help
from our friends at Victoria's Secret.</i>

142
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:38,928
<i>She's a 34B, as in barely anything there.
False advertising.</i>

143
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:43,937
<i>The truth is, she has a nice face.</i>

144
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:46,356
<i>I need to do something
to take my mind off her.</i>

145
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:51,357
<i>Easy enough, except I need an idea.</i>

146
00:08:55,074 --> 00:08:57,283
<i>I'm a little intoxicated,
I'm not gonna lie.</i>

147
00:08:57,284 --> 00:08:59,285
<i>So what if it's not even 10:00 p. M.
And it's a Tuesday night?</i>

148
00:08:59,286 --> 00:09:00,412
Billy.

149
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:02,247
<i>The Kirk/and facebook
is open on my desktop,</i>

150
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:05,917
<i>and some of these people have
pretty horrendous facebook pics.</i>

151
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:08,712
<i>Billy Olson's sitting here and had
the idea of putting some of the pictures</i>

152
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:12,048
<i>next to pictures of farm animals
and have people vote on who's hotter.</i>

153
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:17,049
<i>Good call, Mr Olson.</i>

154
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:23,101
<i>Yeah, it's on.
I'm not gonna do the farm animals,</i>

155
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:24,978
<i>but/ like the idea of comparing
two people together.</i>

156
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:26,604
<i>It gives the whole thing
a very "Turing" feel</i>

157
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:28,606
<i>since people's ratings of the pictures
will be more implicit</i>

158
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:31,276
<i>than, say, choosing a number to
represent each person's hotness,</i>

159
00:09:31,277 --> 00:09:33,069
<i>like they do on hotornot. Com.</i>

160
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,655
<i>The first thing we're going to need
is a lot of pictures.</i>

161
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:37,949
<i>Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep
a public centra/ised facebook,</i>

162
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,117
<i>so I'm going to have to get all the images</i>

163
00:09:39,118 --> 00:09:42,287
<i>from the individual houses
that people are in.</i>

164
00:09:42,288 --> 00:09:47,288
<i>Let the hacking begin.</i>

165
00:09:59,638 --> 00:10:00,764
<i>First up is Kirk/and.</i>

166
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:03,808
<i>They keep everything open and allow
indexes in their Apache configuration.</i>

167
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:08,480
<i>So a little Wget magic is all that's necessary
to download the entire Kirk/and facebook.</i>

168
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:13,481
<i>Kids' stuff.</i>

169
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:28,124
<i>Next is Eliot.</i>

170
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,335
<i>They're also open,
but with no indexes on Apache.</i>

171
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:31,461
<i>I can run an empty search</i>

172
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:33,880
<i>and it returns all of the images
in the database in a single page.</i>

173
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:37,300
<i>And I can save the page and Mozilla
will save all the images for me.</i>

174
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:39,344
<i>Excel/ent. Moving right along.</i>

175
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:41,513
Excuse me! Everybody!

176
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:45,016
You are at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs,

177
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:48,186
not just at Harvard, but in the world.

178
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:49,312
And I want to welcome you all

179
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:54,313
to Phoenix Club's first party
of the fall semester!

180
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:02,575
<i>Lowe/I has some security.
They require a user name/password Combo,</i>

181
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:05,870
<i>and I'm gonna go ahead and say they don't
have access to the main FAS user database,</i>

182
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:08,206
<i>so they have no way
of detecting an intrusion.</i>

183
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:12,043
<i>Adams has no security, but limits
the number of results to 20 a page.</i>

184
00:11:12,044 --> 00:11:16,714
<i>All I need to do is break out the same
script I used on Lowell and we're set.</i>

185
00:11:16,715 --> 00:11:19,050
<i>Quincy has no online facebook.
What a sham.</i>

186
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:21,553
<i>Nothing I can do about that.</i>

187
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:22,720
<i>Dunster is intense.</i>

188
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:25,473
<i>Not only is there no public directory,
but there's no directory at all.</i>

189
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:26,599
<i>You have to do searches,</i>

190
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,269
<i>and if your search returns more
than 20 matches, nothing gets returned.</i>

191
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,604
<i>And once you do get results,
they don't link directly to the images.</i>

192
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:34,274
<i>They link to a PHP that redirects
or something. Weird.</i>

193
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:35,817
<i>This may be difficult.
I'll come back later.</i>

194
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:38,236
<i>- Hey, Shark Week's on.
- What?</i>

195
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:40,446
- Great white, beautiful fish.
- Nice.

196
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:42,240
<i>Leverett is a little better.
They still make you search,</i>

197
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:45,410
<i>but you can do an empty search and get links
to pages with every student's picture.</i>

198
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:48,163
<i>It's slightly obnoxious that they
only let you view one picture at a time,</i>

199
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:51,124
<i>and there's no way I'm going to go to 500
pages to download pics one at a time.</i>

200
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:56,125
<i>So it's definitely necessary to break out
Emacs and modify that Perl script.</i>

201
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:10,181
Here you go.

202
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:13,313
<i>Done.</i>

203
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:15,190
Hey, what's going on?

204
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:18,943
<i>Perfect timing. Eduardo's here
and he's going to have the key ingredient.</i>

205
00:12:18,944 --> 00:12:20,653
- Hey, Mark.
- Wardo.

206
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:22,780
You and Erica split up.

207
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:23,948
How did you know that?

208
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:26,451
It's on your blog.

209
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:28,161
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

210
00:12:28,162 --> 00:12:30,705
- I need you.
- I'm here for you.

211
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:32,707
No, I need the algorithm you use
to rank chess players.

212
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:37,337
- Are you okay?
- We're ranking girls.

213
00:12:37,338 --> 00:12:39,464
- You mean other students.
- Yeah.

214
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:41,341
You think this is such a good idea?

215
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:42,800
- I need the algorithm.
- Mark...

216
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:45,970
I need the algorithm.

217
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:48,389
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.

218
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:52,977
At any given time Girl A has a rating R-a
and Girl B has a rating R-b.

219
00:12:52,978 --> 00:12:55,813
When any two girls are matched up,
there's an expectation of which will win

220
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:56,981
based on their current rating, right?

221
00:12:56,982 --> 00:13:00,652
Yeah. And those expectations
are expressed this way.

222
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:05,653
Let's write it.

223
00:13:16,877 --> 00:13:19,045
One on the left.

224
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:20,505
The right.

225
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:22,006
Yeah, still the right.

226
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:23,883
- It works.
- Who should we send it to first?

227
00:13:23,884 --> 00:13:25,009
- Dwyer.
- NeaL.

228
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,221
- Who are you gonna send it to?
- Just a couple of people.

229
00:13:28,222 --> 00:13:29,597
The question is,

230
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:34,598
who are they gonna send it to?

231
00:14:01,046 --> 00:14:04,757
Hey, guys, check this out.

232
00:14:04,758 --> 00:14:06,718
Someone go to the left. Dude, do left.

233
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:09,304
Look at these girls. Right or left?

234
00:14:09,305 --> 00:14:12,807
- Left is hot.
- Left? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

235
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:14,434
Right or left?

236
00:14:14,435 --> 00:14:16,311
That's my roommate.

237
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:19,731
- Oh, my God.
- The girl on the left.

238
00:14:19,732 --> 00:14:21,399
This is pathetic.

239
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,567
Right.

240
00:14:22,568 --> 00:14:24,319
Left.

241
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,487
- Leñ.
- Leñ?

242
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:28,656
Oh, shit.

243
00:14:28,657 --> 00:14:31,242
Albright.

244
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:33,119
He blogged about you.

245
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,120
You don't wanna read it.

246
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,418
Left.

247
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:41,627
Laüna.

248
00:14:41,628 --> 00:14:43,629
Erica.

249
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,256
Is this yours?

250
00:14:45,257 --> 00:14:46,799
I stole it from a tranny.

251
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,510
Get the hell out of here!

252
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:51,596
- Leñ.
- One on the right.

253
00:14:51,597 --> 00:14:52,097
Left.

254
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:03,191
Man, that's an awful lot of traffic.

255
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:08,192
You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down
before we get into trouble?

256
00:15:15,537 --> 00:15:18,539
Hello?

257
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,793
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?

258
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:22,919
At 4:00 in the morning?

259
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,339
Well, there's a very unusual amount
of traffic to the switch at Kirkland.

260
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,674
You're saying it's unusual
for 4:00 in the morning?

261
00:15:28,675 --> 00:15:32,428
No, this'd be unusual
for halftime at the Super Bowl.

262
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:36,516
All right.

263
00:15:36,517 --> 00:15:38,559
I gotta go in.

264
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,311
What's going on?

265
00:15:40,312 --> 00:15:45,312
Harvard's network is about to crash.

266
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:52,365
You don't think...

267
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:54,283
I do.

268
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:59,284
Go see if it's everybody's.

269
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,544
I can't connect.

270
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:07,338
The network's down.

271
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:09,173
Unless it's a coincidence,
I think this is us.

272
00:16:09,174 --> 00:16:11,050
It's not a coincidence.

273
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:16,051
Holy shit.

274
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,516
So you were called in
front of the Ad Board.

275
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:20,268
That's not what happened.

276
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:21,978
You weren't called in front
of the Administrative Board?

277
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:25,815
No, back. I mean back at the bar
with Erica Albright. She said all that?

278
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,525
- Mark...
- That I said that stuff to her?

279
00:16:27,526 --> 00:16:29,277
I was reading from the transcript
of her deposition.

280
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:31,028
Yeah, why would you even need
to depose her?

281
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,780
That's really for us to decide.

282
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:36,409
You think if I know she can make me look
like a jerk, I'll be more likely to settle.

283
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,910
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute?

284
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:39,745
Can we do that?
It's been almost three hours.

285
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:43,499
And frankly, you did spend an awful lot
of time embarrassing Mr Zuckerberg

286
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,418
with the girl's testimony from the bar.

287
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:47,128
I'm not embarrassed,
she just made a lot of that up.

288
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:48,296
She was under oath.

289
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:53,297
Then I guess that would be the first time
somebody's lied under oath.

290
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:04,896
The site got 2,200 hits within two hours?

291
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:06,022
Thousand.

292
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:08,316
What?

293
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:12,445
Twenty-two thousand.

294
00:17:12,446 --> 00:17:12,946
Wow.

295
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:35,464
These guys are just freakin' fast.

296
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,057
Is there any way to make this a fair fight?

297
00:17:41,058 --> 00:17:43,267
Jump out and swim.

298
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:45,520
I think we'd have to jump out and drown.

299
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:48,648
Well, you could row fen/vard
and I could row backward.

300
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:51,984
We're genetically identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.

301
00:17:51,985 --> 00:17:56,985
Just row the damn boat.

302
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:02,995
- You guys hear about this?
- What?

303
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:06,707
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked
the network from a laptop at Kirkland.

304
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,751
- Really?
- At 4:00 a.m.

305
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:09,877
How?

306
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:13,422
He set up a website where you vote
on the hotness of female undergrads.

307
00:18:13,423 --> 00:18:14,924
What were we doing
that none of us heard about this?

308
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:16,050
I don't know.

309
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:18,678
A three-hour low-rate
technical row before breakfast.

310
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:20,221
Full course load. Studying.

311
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:22,598
Another three hours in the tank
and then studying.

312
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,891
I'm not sure how we missed it.

313
00:18:23,892 --> 00:18:25,643
How much activity was there on this thing?

314
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:28,271
Twenty-two thousand page requests.

315
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:29,397
Twenty-two thousand?

316
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:31,941
Cam, this guy hacked
the facebook of seven houses.

317
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:34,694
He set up the whole website in one night,
and he did it while he was drunk.

318
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:36,445
Twenty-two thousand?

319
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:40,449
- Well, how do you know he was drunk?
- He was blogging simultaneously.

320
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,202
- You know what I think?
- Way ahead of you.

321
00:18:43,203 --> 00:18:45,580
This is our guy.

322
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:46,956
Cameron Winklevoss.

323
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:50,251
W-I-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S.

324
00:18:50,252 --> 00:18:51,627
"Cameron" spelled the usual way.

325
00:18:51,628 --> 00:18:53,296
Tyler Winklevoss.

326
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:56,799
Tyler spelled the usual way, and my
last name is the same as my brother's.

327
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,845
Mr Zuckerberg, this is
an Administrative Board hearing.

328
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:03,806
You're being accused
of intentionally breaching security,

329
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,308
violating copyrights,

330
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:10,309
violating individual privacy
by creating the website wwviLfacemashcom.

331
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:13,566
You're also charged with
being in violation of university policy,

332
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,860
on distribution of digitised images.

333
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:18,988
Before we begin with our questioning,
you're allowed to make a statement.

334
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:21,115
Would you like to do so?

335
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:23,326
L..

336
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:28,039
You know, I've already apologised
in The Crimson to the ABHW,

337
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,707
to Fuerza Latina,

338
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,126
and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted,

339
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:35,087
as I take it that they were.

340
00:19:35,088 --> 00:19:37,423
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security,

341
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:42,424
I believe I deserve
some recognition from this board.

342
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:45,306
- I'm sorry?
- Yes.

343
00:19:45,307 --> 00:19:46,599
I don't understand.

344
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,142
Which part?

345
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:50,394
You deserve recognition?

346
00:19:50,395 --> 00:19:53,105
I believe I've pointed out
some pretty gaping holes in your system.

347
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:56,192
- Excuse me, may I?
- Yes.

348
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:57,693
Mr Zuckerberg,

349
00:19:57,694 --> 00:20:00,988
I'm in charge of security
for all computers on the Harvard network,

350
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:03,491
and I can assure you of its sophistication.

351
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:07,495
In fact, it was that level of sophistication
that led us to you in less than four hours.

352
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:08,871
- Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

353
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:09,997
That would be impressive,

354
00:20:09,998 --> 00:20:11,415
except if you had known
what you were looking for,

355
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:16,416
you would have seen it
written on my dorm room window.

356
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:20,049
So?

357
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,593
Six months academic probation.

358
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:24,804
Wow. Well, they had to make
an example out of you.

359
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:26,472
They had my blog.

360
00:20:26,473 --> 00:20:28,349
I shouldn't have written
that thing about the farm animals.

361
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,725
That was stupid.

362
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:32,895
But I was kidding, for God's sakes.
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humour?

363
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:35,398
- I tried to stop you.
- I know.

364
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:39,026
How do you do this thing where
you manage to get all girls to hate us?

365
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:41,028
- And why do I let you?
- I know.

366
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:43,614
- You can't do that.
- Wardo, I said I know.

367
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:45,783
Okay, let's look at a sample problem.

368
00:20:45,784 --> 00:20:49,245
Suppose we're given a computer
with a 16-bit virtual address

369
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:52,456
and a page size of 256 bytes.

370
00:20:52,457 --> 00:20:57,378
The system uses one-level page tables
that start at address hex 400.

371
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:01,006
Maybe you want DMA on your 16-bit system.
Who knows?

372
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:04,385
The first few pages are reserved
for hardware flags, etc.

373
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:07,805
Assume page-table entries have
eight status bits.

374
00:21:07,806 --> 00:21:10,266
The eight status bits would then be...

375
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,810
Anybody?

376
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:15,354
And I see we have our first surrender.

377
00:21:15,355 --> 00:21:16,731
Don't worry, Mr Zuckerberg.

378
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:19,024
Brighter men than you
have tried and failed this class.

379
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:24,025
One valid bit, one modified bit,
one reference bit and five permission bits.

380
00:21:25,824 --> 00:21:27,908
That is correct.

381
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:32,909
Does everybody see how he got there?

382
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,835
Mark?

383
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:40,379
- You Mark Zuckerberg?
- Yeah.

384
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,381
- Cameron Winklevoss.
- Hi.

385
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:43,507
Tyler Winklevoss.

386
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:44,967
Are you guys related?

387
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:46,552
- That's good.
- Funny.

388
00:21:46,553 --> 00:21:48,512
We never heard that before.

389
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:50,473
So, what can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?

390
00:21:50,474 --> 00:21:52,641
No. You didn't. Actually, I don't know.

391
00:21:52,642 --> 00:21:54,435
- Yeah, we never asked.
- We should do that.

392
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:55,561
No.

393
00:21:55,562 --> 00:21:58,856
We have an idea
we want to talk to you about.

394
00:21:58,857 --> 00:21:59,982
You got a minute?

395
00:21:59,983 --> 00:22:03,110
You guys look like
you spend some time at the gym.

396
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:04,737
- We have to.
- Why?

397
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:07,531
We row crew.

398
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:12,532
- Yeah, I've got a minute.
- Great.

399
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,165
- So, you ever been inside the Porcellian?
- No.

400
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,875
You understand we can't take you
past the bike room,

401
00:22:17,876 --> 00:22:19,043
because you're not a member.

402
00:22:19,044 --> 00:22:23,214
I've heard.

403
00:22:23,215 --> 00:22:26,300
- You want a sandwich or something?
- Okay.

404
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:28,052
- Mark, right?
- Yeah.

405
00:22:28,053 --> 00:22:30,137
- Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

406
00:22:30,138 --> 00:22:32,056
We were really impressed with Facemash.

407
00:22:32,057 --> 00:22:34,725
When we checked you out,
you also built CourseMatch.

408
00:22:34,726 --> 00:22:35,851
I don't know CourseMatch.

409
00:22:35,852 --> 00:22:38,354
You go online and see
what courses your friends are taking.

410
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:42,149
It's really smart, man.

411
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,317
- Mark.
- Yeah.

412
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:46,779
We were talking about CourseMatch.

413
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,239
It was kind of a no-brainer.

414
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,699
But you invented something
in high school, too, right?

415
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,537
An app for an MP3 player
that recognises your taste in music.

416
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:56,372
Anybody try to buy it?

417
00:22:56,373 --> 00:22:57,498
Microsoft.

418
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:59,667
Wow. How much?

419
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:01,836
Didn't sell it. Uploaded it for free.

420
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:03,671
- For free?
- Yeah.

421
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:06,674
Why?

422
00:23:06,675 --> 00:23:09,301
Okay, well, we have something
that we've been working on for a while

423
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:10,469
and we think it's great.

424
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,804
It's called the Harvard Connection.

425
00:23:11,805 --> 00:23:15,307
You create your own page.
Interests, bio, friends, pics.

426
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:17,685
And then people can go online,
see your bio, request to be your...

427
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:22,686
Yeah, how is that different
from MySpace or Friendster?

428
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,234
Harvard. ed...

429
00:23:25,235 --> 00:23:27,736
Harvard.edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country, man.

430
00:23:27,737 --> 00:23:30,114
I mean, the whole site's kind of
based on the idea that girls...

431
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:32,116
Not to put anything indelicately, but...

432
00:23:32,117 --> 00:23:33,951
Girls wanna go with guys
who go to Harvard.

433
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:36,328
Divya and my brother don't have trouble
putting things indelicately.

434
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:39,957
The main difference between what we're
talking about and MySpace or Friendster,

435
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,458
or any of those other
social networking sites is...

436
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:45,004
Is exclusivity. Right?

437
00:23:45,005 --> 00:23:46,130
- Right.
- Yeah.

438
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:47,673
We'd love for you to work with us, Mark.

439
00:23:47,674 --> 00:23:49,466
I mean, we need a gifted programmer
who's creative.

440
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:51,176
And we know that
you've been taking it in the shins.

441
00:23:51,177 --> 00:23:54,179
Women's groups are ready
to declare a fatwa.

442
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,349
But, you know, this could help
rehabilitate your image.

443
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:02,313
Wow. You would do that for me?

444
00:24:02,314 --> 00:24:03,439
We'd like to work with you.

445
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,609
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work for Google.

446
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,278
Our second programmer
just got oven verned with schoolwork.

447
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,531
We would need you to build the site and write
the code, and we'll provide all the...

448
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:15,326
I'm in.

449
00:24:15,327 --> 00:24:17,494
What?

450
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:18,954
I'm in.

451
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:20,497
Awesome.

452
00:24:20,498 --> 00:24:22,499
That's what you said?

453
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,169
It was three or four years ago.
I don't know what I said.

454
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,879
When did you come to Eduardo?

455
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,672
I don't understand that question.

456
00:24:28,673 --> 00:24:31,008
Do you remember answering
in the affirmative?

457
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:32,217
The affirmative?

458
00:24:32,218 --> 00:24:34,511
When did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for Facebook?

459
00:24:34,512 --> 00:24:37,014
It was called The Facebook then.

460
00:24:37,015 --> 00:24:39,016
This doesn't need to be that difficult.

461
00:24:39,017 --> 00:24:41,185
I'm currently in the middle
of two different lawsuits.

462
00:24:41,186 --> 00:24:42,686
Did you answer affirmatively

463
00:24:42,687 --> 00:24:45,189
when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Divya Narendra

464
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,857
asked you to build Harvard Connection?

465
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:50,194
Did you say yes?

466
00:24:50,195 --> 00:24:51,528
I said I'd help.

467
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:54,573
When did you approach Mr Saverin
with the idea for The Facebook?

468
00:24:54,574 --> 00:24:56,200
I wouldn't say I approached him.

469
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:58,410
- Sy.
- You can answer the question.

470
00:24:58,411 --> 00:25:00,913
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.

471
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:02,373
What's that?

472
00:25:02,374 --> 00:25:05,542
The Jewish fraternity.

473
00:25:05,543 --> 00:25:10,543
It was Caribbean Night.

474
00:25:24,396 --> 00:25:27,231
It's not that guys like me
are generally attracted to Asian girls.

475
00:25:27,232 --> 00:25:30,234
It's that Asian girls are
generally attracted to guys like me.

476
00:25:30,235 --> 00:25:32,361
I'm developing an algorithm
to define the connection

477
00:25:32,362 --> 00:25:34,363
between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

478
00:25:34,364 --> 00:25:37,408
I don't think it's that complicated.
They're hot, they're smart,

479
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:40,536
they're not Jewish, and they can't dance.

480
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:42,037
Hey, Mark's here.

481
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:42,538
Mark!

482
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:51,376
Be right back.

483
00:25:55,468 --> 00:25:56,593
I think I've come up with something.

484
00:25:56,594 --> 00:25:58,929
Hang on. I gotta tell you something
that you're not gonna believe.

485
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,055
What?

486
00:26:00,056 --> 00:26:03,600
I got punched by the Phoenix.

487
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:04,727
- Are you kidding?
- No.

488
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:07,104
I mean, it's just the first
of a four-step process,

489
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:09,982
but they slid the invitation
under my door tonight.

490
00:26:09,983 --> 00:26:11,942
I go to my first punch party tomorrow.

491
00:26:11,943 --> 00:26:13,610
So...

492
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:15,738
You got punched by the Phoenix.

493
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:18,949
Yeah, but, you know,
it was probably just a diversity thing.

494
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,118
It was just a diversity thing.
Just ride that horse until...

495
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,911
What did you wanna talk to me about?

496
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:24,455
- Mark?
- Yeah.

497
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:25,581
You said you'd come up with something.

498
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:28,292
Yeah, I think I've come up with something.
Come outside and let's talk.

499
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:29,626
It's 20 degrees outside.

500
00:26:29,627 --> 00:26:31,920
I can't stare at that
loop of Niagara Falls,

501
00:26:31,921 --> 00:26:36,921
which has absolutely
nothing to do with the Caribbean.

502
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:47,186
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?

503
00:26:47,187 --> 00:26:48,353
Yeah.

504
00:26:48,354 --> 00:26:50,022
But it wasn't because
they saw pictures of hot girls.

505
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:52,316
You can go anywhere on the Internet
and see pictures of hot girls.

506
00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:53,484
Yeah.

507
00:26:53,485 --> 00:26:56,612
It was because they saw pictures
of girls that they knew.

508
00:26:56,613 --> 00:26:58,655
People want to go on the Internet
and check out their friends,

509
00:26:58,656 --> 00:27:00,157
so why not build a website
that offers that?

510
00:27:00,158 --> 00:27:03,368
Friends, pictures, profiles,
whatever you can visit.

511
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:05,287
Browse around.
Maybe it's someone you just met at a party.

512
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:07,498
But I'm not talking about a dating site.

513
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:12,499
I'm talking about taking the entire social
experience of college and putting it online.

514
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:15,672
- I can't feel my legs.
- I know.

515
00:27:15,673 --> 00:27:17,299
I'm totally psyched about this, too.
But, Wardo?

516
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,509
Yeah?

517
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,011
"It would be exclusive."

518
00:27:21,012 --> 00:27:23,680
You would have to know the people
on the site to get past your own page.

519
00:27:23,681 --> 00:27:26,517
Like getting punched.

520
00:27:26,518 --> 00:27:27,684
Now, that's good.

521
00:27:27,685 --> 00:27:30,354
Wardo, it's like a final club,
except we're the president.

522
00:27:30,355 --> 00:27:33,816
I told him I thought it sounded great.

523
00:27:33,817 --> 00:27:35,317
It was a great idea.

524
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:36,401
There was nothing to hack.

525
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:39,530
People were gonna provide
their own pictures, their own information.

526
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:44,531
And people had the ability to invite,
or not invite, their friends to join.

527
00:27:44,994 --> 00:27:49,081
See, in a world where
social structure was everything,

528
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:50,916
that was the thing.

529
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:52,376
It was a big project,

530
00:27:52,377 --> 00:27:55,587
and he was going to have to write
tens of thousands of lines of code,

531
00:27:55,588 --> 00:27:58,298
so I wondered why he was
coming to me and not his roommates,

532
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:01,093
Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.
They were programmers.

533
00:28:01,094 --> 00:28:05,597
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent the servers and get it online.

534
00:28:05,598 --> 00:28:06,723
So that was why.

535
00:28:06,724 --> 00:28:08,433
- Did he offer terms?
- Yes.

536
00:28:08,434 --> 00:28:10,561
We'll Split it, 70/30.

537
00:28:10,562 --> 00:28:13,105
70 for me, 30 for you
for putting up the $1,000

538
00:28:13,106 --> 00:28:15,440
and for handling everything
on the business end. You're CFO.

539
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:16,567
<i>And you said?</i>

540
00:28:16,568 --> 00:28:18,277
I said, "Let's do it."

541
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:20,571
Okay. Did he add anything else?

542
00:28:20,572 --> 00:28:21,072
Yes.

543
00:28:25,326 --> 00:28:29,121
It probably was a diversity thing.

544
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:30,455
But so what?

545
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:31,832
Why do you think he said that?

546
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:34,126
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting,
but whose discovery is this?

547
00:28:34,127 --> 00:28:35,961
Sy, if you'll let me continue
with my line of questioning.

548
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:37,129
What are you suggesting?

549
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,423
That I was jealous of Eduardo
for getting punched by the Phoenix

550
00:28:39,424 --> 00:28:41,091
and began a plan
to screw him out of a company.

551
00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:42,843
- I hadn't even invented yet.
- Were you?

552
00:28:42,844 --> 00:28:44,178
- Gretchen.
- Jealous of Eduardo?

553
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:45,512
Stop typing. We're off the record.

554
00:28:45,513 --> 00:28:46,638
Ma'am, I know you've done your homework,

555
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:48,307
and so you know that money
isn't a big part of my life.

556
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:50,434
But at the moment,
I could buy Mount Auburn Street,

557
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:55,435
take the Phoenix Club
and turn it into my ping-pong room.

558
00:28:57,817 --> 00:29:02,817
I'll let you know how the party is.

559
00:29:05,658 --> 00:29:09,119
<i>We recognise that you're a plaintiff
in one suit involving Facebook,</i>

560
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,537
and a witness in another.

561
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:11,705
Yes, sir.

562
00:29:11,706 --> 00:29:14,791
At any time in the weeks
prior to Mark's telling you his idea,

563
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:17,377
did he mention Tyler Winklevoss,
Cameron Winklevoss,

564
00:29:17,378 --> 00:29:19,796
Divya Narendra or Harvard Connection?

565
00:29:19,797 --> 00:29:22,507
Yes. He said they'd asked him
to work on their site,

566
00:29:22,508 --> 00:29:26,511
but that he looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

567
00:29:26,512 --> 00:29:28,180
He said even his most pathetic friends

568
00:29:28,181 --> 00:29:32,142
knew more about getting people
interested in a website than these guys.

569
00:29:32,143 --> 00:29:34,144
"These guys," meaning my clients.

570
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:38,190
Yes. He resented...
Mark resented that your clients thought

571
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:40,692
that he needed to rehabilitate
his image after Facemash.

572
00:29:40,693 --> 00:29:42,861
But Mark didn't want
to rehabilitate anything.

573
00:29:42,862 --> 00:29:45,739
With Facemash, he'd hacked into
the Harvard computers,

574
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,492
he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board,
he'd gotten a lot of notoriety.

575
00:29:48,493 --> 00:29:51,161
Facemash did exactly
what he wanted it to do.

576
00:29:51,162 --> 00:29:53,705
Were you aware that while Mr Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

577
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:55,582
he was also communicating
with the plaintiffs?

578
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:59,670
Not at the time, I wasn't. But...

579
00:29:59,671 --> 00:30:02,547
It really didn't have much to do
with the Winklevosses' dating site.

580
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:03,674
How would you know?
You weren't even there.

581
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:05,092
Ty.

582
00:30:05,093 --> 00:30:08,262
Were you aware that while Mr Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

583
00:30:08,263 --> 00:30:11,848
he was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building Harvard Connection?

584
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:13,350
You're offering a conclusion
not found in evidence.

585
00:30:13,351 --> 00:30:16,561
We are about to find it in evidence.

586
00:30:16,562 --> 00:30:19,022
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Wink/evoss.</i>

587
00:30:19,023 --> 00:30:20,691
<i>November 30th, 2003.</i>

588
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:23,777
<i>"I read over all the stuff you sent me
re: Harvard Connection."</i>

589
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:26,530
<i>"And it seems like it shouldn't 't
take too long to implement."</i>

590
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:31,368
"So we can talk about it after I get all
the basic functionality up tomorrow night."

591
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:35,872
From Mark Zuckerberg
to Cameron Winklevoss. December 1st, 2003.

592
00:30:35,873 --> 00:30:39,418
<i>"Sonyl was unreachable tonight. I just
got about three of your missed calls."</i>

593
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,379
<i>"I was working on a problem set
for my systems class."</i>

594
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,715
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg
to Tyler and Cameron Wink/evoss.</i>

595
00:30:44,716 --> 00:30:47,467
<i>December 10, 2003.</i>

596
00:30:47,468 --> 00:30:50,220
<i>"This week has been pretty busy
thus far with classes and work,"</i>

597
00:30:50,221 --> 00:30:53,432
<i>"so I think it's probably best
to postpone the meeting."</i>

598
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:55,642
"I'm also really busy tomorrow."

599
00:30:55,643 --> 00:30:59,104
Okay, anybody else feel like
there's something up with this guy?

600
00:30:59,105 --> 00:31:00,230
Tell him okay,

601
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:03,567
but we do have to make sure that
we meet up before we all go off for break.

602
00:31:03,568 --> 00:31:08,568
I know, I know. Yeah, watch out.

603
00:31:37,268 --> 00:31:38,602
Hey, Mark.

604
00:31:38,603 --> 00:31:41,605
I need a dedicated Linux box
running Apache with a MySQL back end.

605
00:31:41,606 --> 00:31:43,148
It's gonna cost a little more money.

606
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:45,692
- How much more?
- About 200 more.

607
00:31:45,693 --> 00:31:50,693
- Do we need it?
- Gotta handle the traffic.

608
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:56,449
- Do it.
- I already did.

609
00:31:57,663 --> 00:32:00,499
Hey, guess what?

610
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,834
I made the second cut.

611
00:32:02,835 --> 00:32:03,960
That's good.

612
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:08,961
You should be proud of that right there. Don't
worry if you don't make it any further.

613
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,012
I'll get out of here.

614
00:32:14,013 --> 00:32:16,431
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg
to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss</i>

615
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:17,557
and Divya Narendra.

616
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:19,810
December 15th, 2003.

617
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:22,270
"I have a CS problem set
that I'm just getting started with"

618
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:26,024
"and it should be about 15 hours of coding,
so I'll be busy tomorrow night."

619
00:32:26,025 --> 00:32:29,444
"I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon."

620
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:31,655
"I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon."

621
00:32:31,656 --> 00:32:34,950
"I've basically been in the lab
this whole time, and also"

622
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:39,951
"...won't be able to do Saturday,
as I have to meet up with my parents."

623
00:32:43,668 --> 00:32:48,171
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.

624
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:51,299
It's also called the Statue of Three Lies.

625
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,302
What are the three lies?

626
00:32:54,303 --> 00:32:55,512
Mr Dowd.

627
00:32:55,513 --> 00:32:57,764
The three lies. First...

628
00:32:57,765 --> 00:32:58,890
Shit!

629
00:32:58,891 --> 00:33:01,893
- Take your pants off.
- I know.

630
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:03,228
Mr Saverin.

631
00:33:03,229 --> 00:33:06,857
One, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638.

632
00:33:06,858 --> 00:33:09,276
Two, Harvard was not founded
by John Harvard.

633
00:33:09,277 --> 00:33:10,902
And three, that is not John Harvard.

634
00:33:10,903 --> 00:33:12,821
Who is it?

635
00:33:12,822 --> 00:33:17,367
It's a friend of the
sculptor, Daniel Chester.

636
00:33:17,368 --> 00:33:22,368
Keep yourjacket on.

637
00:33:22,457 --> 00:33:26,001
Thirty-nine days after Mr Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients,

638
00:33:26,002 --> 00:33:29,504
and he still hadn't completed work
on Harvard Connection.

639
00:33:29,505 --> 00:33:33,008
<i>But on January 11th, 2004,</i>

640
00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:36,303
<i>Mr Zuckerberg registered
the domain name The Facebook</i>

641
00:33:36,304 --> 00:33:40,265
<i>via Network Solutions.</i>

642
00:33:40,266 --> 00:33:45,266
To the best of your knowledge, had he even
begun work on Harvard Connection?

643
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:50,396
Not to my knowledge. No.

644
00:33:51,736 --> 00:33:54,988
What in the world is this?

645
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:59,159
"Hey, Cameron, I'm still a little sceptical
that we have enough functionality in the site

646
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,953
"to really draw the attention
and gain the critical mass necessary

647
00:34:01,954 --> 00:34:04,998
"to get a site like this to run"?

648
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:08,668
"We'll speak soon"?

649
00:34:08,669 --> 00:34:11,421
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem?

650
00:34:11,422 --> 00:34:12,547
Yes, it was.

651
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:17,135
You sent 36 e-mails to Mr Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return,

652
00:34:17,136 --> 00:34:19,804
and this was the first time
he indicated he was not happy.

653
00:34:19,805 --> 00:34:20,931
That's correct.

654
00:34:20,932 --> 00:34:23,683
He had 42 days to study our system
and get out ahead.

655
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:25,852
- Do you see any of your code on Facebook?
- Sy, could you...

656
00:34:25,853 --> 00:34:27,479
Did I use any of your code?

657
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,397
You stole our whole goddamn idea.

658
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:31,691
- FeHas.
- What? Match.com for Harvard guys?

659
00:34:31,692 --> 00:34:32,901
Can I continue with my deposition?

660
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:36,112
You know, you really don't need a forensics
team to get to the bottom of this.

661
00:34:36,113 --> 00:34:39,115
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,

662
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:41,910
you'd have invented Facebook.

663
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:44,579
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder
and watch you write us a cheque.

664
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,624
No shit.

665
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:50,627
Let's continue.

666
00:34:50,628 --> 00:34:55,628
February 4, 2004.

667
00:34:56,676 --> 00:34:58,593
Mark.

668
00:34:58,594 --> 00:34:59,844
Mark.

669
00:34:59,845 --> 00:35:03,807
There is a girl in your art history class.
Her name is Stephanie Attis.

670
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:07,143
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?

671
00:35:07,144 --> 00:35:11,523
Have you ever seen her with anyone?

672
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:14,776
And, if not, do you happen to know
if she's looking to go out with anyone?

673
00:35:14,777 --> 00:35:17,487
Dustin.

674
00:35:17,488 --> 00:35:22,488
People don't walk around with
a sign on them that says...

675
00:35:25,371 --> 00:35:25,871
Mark?

676
00:35:53,149 --> 00:35:55,483
We were supposed to meet at 9:00.

677
00:35:55,484 --> 00:35:58,320
- Have you slept yet?
- I have to add something.

678
00:35:58,321 --> 00:35:58,821
What?

679
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,709
Shit, that looks good.
That looks really good.

680
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,252
It's clean and simple.

681
00:36:14,253 --> 00:36:18,340
No Disneyland, no "live nude girls."
But watch.

682
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:20,342
What'd you write?

683
00:36:20,343 --> 00:36:23,261
"Relationship Status." "interested In."

684
00:36:23,262 --> 00:36:26,222
This is what drives life at college.
"Are you having sex or aren't you?"

685
00:36:26,223 --> 00:36:29,601
It's why people take certain classes
and sit where they sit and do what they do.

686
00:36:29,602 --> 00:36:33,563
And at its centre, you know, that's
what The Facebook is gonna be about.

687
00:36:33,564 --> 00:36:35,857
People are gonna log on because
after all the cake and watermelon,

688
00:36:35,858 --> 00:36:36,983
there's a chance they're actually gonna...

689
00:36:36,984 --> 00:36:39,778
- Gonna get laid.
- ...meet a girl. Yes.

690
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:40,904
That is really good.

691
00:36:40,905 --> 00:36:42,030
And that was it.

692
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:43,782
- What do you mean?
- It's ready.

693
00:36:43,783 --> 00:36:46,493
- It's ready? Right now?
- Yeah. That was it.

694
00:36:46,494 --> 00:36:48,078
And here's the masthead.

695
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,621
- You made a masthead.
- Yeah.

696
00:36:49,622 --> 00:36:53,083
- "Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO."
- Yeah.

697
00:36:53,084 --> 00:36:55,210
You have no idea what
that's gonna mean to my father.

698
00:36:55,211 --> 00:36:59,047
Sure I do.

699
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:01,675
So when's it going live?

700
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:04,761
Right now. Get your laptop out.

701
00:37:04,762 --> 00:37:06,930
What? Why do we need my laptop?

702
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:11,931
Because you got e-mails
for everybody at the Phoenix.

703
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:18,108
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool
with them that I spam their e-mails.

704
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:20,902
- This is not spam.
- No, I know it's not spam.

705
00:37:20,903 --> 00:37:23,321
If we send it to our friends,
it's just gonna bounce around Dworkin.

706
00:37:23,322 --> 00:37:24,739
I haven't gotten in yet.

707
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:29,619
These guys know people.
And I need their e-mails.

708
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,080
- Sure.
- Good.

709
00:37:32,081 --> 00:37:33,206
Give me the mailing list.

710
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:35,625
Jabben/v0ck12.listserv@harvard. Edu.

711
00:37:35,626 --> 00:37:36,876
These guys.

712
00:37:36,877 --> 00:37:38,002
Yeah, they're literary geniuses

713
00:37:38,003 --> 00:37:40,213
because the world's most obvious
Lewis Carroll reference is in...

714
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:41,840
- They're not so bad.
- I'm just saying.

715
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:46,841
Yeah, you're right.

716
00:37:50,516 --> 00:37:52,976
The site's live.

717
00:37:52,977 --> 00:37:56,688
You know, let's go get
a drink and celebrate.

718
00:37:56,689 --> 00:37:59,524
I'm buying.

719
00:37:59,525 --> 00:38:03,486
Mark.

720
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:08,487
Mark, are you praying?

721
00:38:18,294 --> 00:38:21,004
Whatever happened to Cole Porter
and Irving Berlin?

722
00:38:21,005 --> 00:38:23,089
It's a Valentine's Day theme.
They're playing love songs.

723
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,215
Good point.

724
00:38:24,216 --> 00:38:29,216
'Cause Cole Porter and Irving Berlin
never wrote any love songs.

725
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,391
Honey, you should put your laptop away.

726
00:38:33,392 --> 00:38:35,435
Seven different people
spammed me the same link.

727
00:38:35,436 --> 00:38:37,103
- KC.
- What is it?

728
00:38:37,104 --> 00:38:38,229
I don't know.

729
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,064
But I'm really hoping
it's Cats That Look Like Hitler,

730
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:43,943
'cause I can never get enough of that.

731
00:38:43,944 --> 00:38:48,944
No, it's not.

732
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:51,743
Div!

733
00:38:51,744 --> 00:38:52,244
What?

734
00:38:58,626 --> 00:39:00,460
This isn't mine.

735
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:04,506
Okay, what is wrong?

736
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:09,507
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

737
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:23,525
Hey!

738
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:24,692
Hey!

739
00:39:24,693 --> 00:39:25,944
Not now!

740
00:39:25,945 --> 00:39:27,111
We need 20 minutes!

741
00:39:27,112 --> 00:39:29,656
<i>Okay-</i>

742
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:34,410
I just wanted to let you know
that Zuckerberg stole our website.

743
00:39:34,411 --> 00:39:36,538
Mark Zuckerberg?

744
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:39,207
He stole our website.

745
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:44,208
It's been live for more than 36 hours.

746
00:39:46,048 --> 00:39:48,633
Mr Hotchkiss?
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad.

747
00:39:48,634 --> 00:39:51,261
Yes, sir, I'm here with my brother Tyler
and our business partner Divya.

748
00:39:51,262 --> 00:39:52,387
"Welcome to The Facebook."

749
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:54,389
"The Facebook is an online directory
that connects people"

750
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,932
"through different social networks."

751
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:59,185
"You must have a harvard.edu address
to register."

752
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:01,729
Yeah, I called earlier.
I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.

753
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,147
Yes, sir.
He's actually quoted a couple times.

754
00:40:03,148 --> 00:40:04,274
I can read it to you.

755
00:40:04,275 --> 00:40:07,569
"'Everyone's been talking a lot about a
universal facebook within Harvard, ' he says."

756
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,695
"He" meaning Mark.

757
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:10,738
"'I think it's kind of silly
that it would take the university

758
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:11,948
"'a couple of years to get around to it.

759
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:14,576
"'I can do a classierjob than they can
and I did it in a week."'

760
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:15,869
Tell him Divya Narendra called.

761
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,037
- I know, that's how he talks.
- Appreciate it.

762
00:40:18,038 --> 00:40:20,206
"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,"

763
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:24,043
"over 650 students had registered
to use thefacebook.com."

764
00:40:24,044 --> 00:40:27,755
"He said he anticipated that 900 students
would have joined the site by this morning."

765
00:40:27,756 --> 00:40:31,050
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650
students signed up for it on the first day.

766
00:40:31,051 --> 00:40:35,388
God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't
give free drugs to 650 people in one day.

767
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:38,975
And this guy doesn't have three friends
to rub together to make a fourth.

768
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:40,602
All right.
Yes, that's what we'll do, Mr Hotchkiss.

769
00:40:40,603 --> 00:40:42,604
We'll put all this together
and we'll e-mail it to you.

770
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:45,315
Well, you won't be able
to go on the website yourself.

771
00:40:45,316 --> 00:40:47,650
Because you don't have a Harvard...

772
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:49,986
You know what, it would just be easier
for us to e-mail it to you.

773
00:40:49,987 --> 00:40:51,112
I'm sure you're right.

774
00:40:51,113 --> 00:40:54,073
He's a good guy and he's very bright
and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...

775
00:40:54,074 --> 00:40:55,617
Wow.

776
00:40:55,618 --> 00:40:57,577
What he did.

777
00:40:57,578 --> 00:40:59,621
All right, thank you very much. And, Dad...

778
00:40:59,622 --> 00:41:00,747
All right, love you, too.

779
00:41:00,748 --> 00:41:03,583
- This is a good guy?
- We don't know that he's not a good guy.

780
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:04,667
We know he stole our idea.

781
00:41:04,668 --> 00:41:06,169
We know he lied to our faces
for a month and a half.

782
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,421
- No, he never lied to our faces.
- Okay, he never saw our faces.

783
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:11,925
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts
and he gave himself a 42-day head start,

784
00:41:11,926 --> 00:41:14,010
because he knows
what apparently you don't,

785
00:41:14,011 --> 00:41:15,845
which is that getting there first
is everything.

786
00:41:15,846 --> 00:41:16,971
I'm a competitive racer, Div.

787
00:41:16,972 --> 00:41:20,683
I don't think you need to school me in the
importance of getting there first. Thank you.

788
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:22,852
- That was your father's lawyer?
- It was his in-house counsel.

789
00:41:22,853 --> 00:41:24,854
He's gonna look at all this
and if he thinks it's appropriate

790
00:41:24,855 --> 00:41:25,980
he'll send a cease-and-desist letter.

791
00:41:25,981 --> 00:41:27,106
What's that gonna do?

792
00:41:27,107 --> 00:41:28,524
What, do you wanna hire an IP lawyer
and sue him?

793
00:41:28,525 --> 00:41:31,778
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer.

794
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:32,987
- We don't even have to do that.
- That's right.

795
00:41:32,988 --> 00:41:36,366
We could do that ourselves.
I'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me.

796
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:37,492
- I'm with this guy.
- Well, whatever.

797
00:41:37,493 --> 00:41:39,953
I'm saying, let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

798
00:41:39,954 --> 00:41:42,121
How much more information
are you waiting for?

799
00:41:42,122 --> 00:41:45,041
We met with Mark three times,
we exchanged 52 e-mails,

800
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:46,709
we can prove that he looked at the code.

801
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,879
- What is that on the bottom of the page?
- It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production."

802
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,215
- On the home page?
- On every page.

803
00:41:52,216 --> 00:41:55,009
Shit, I need a second to let
the classiness waft over me.

804
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,177
Okay, look, we don't know...

805
00:41:56,178 --> 00:41:58,179
Cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg said
he hoped the privacy options"

806
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,181
"would help restore his reputation"

807
00:42:00,182 --> 00:42:03,226
"following student outrage
over facemash.com."

808
00:42:03,227 --> 00:42:07,230
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us the finger in The Crimson.

809
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:09,399
While we're waiting for Dad's lawyer
to look this stuff over,

810
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,901
we can at least get something
going in the paper so people know...

811
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:13,528
- What?
- ...that this is in dispute.

812
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:15,655
We're not starting a knife fight
in The Crimson.

813
00:42:15,656 --> 00:42:17,198
And we're not suing anybody.

814
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:19,909
Why not?

815
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,579
I don't understand, I don't understand.
Why not?

816
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,498
He's gonna say it's stupid.

817
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:26,582
What, who, me?

818
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:29,502
Say it. Why not?

819
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,754
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

820
00:42:31,755 --> 00:42:36,755
This is Harvard, where you don't
plant stories and you don't sue people.

821
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,762
You thought he was gonna be
the only one who thought that was stupid?

822
00:42:39,763 --> 00:42:43,099
During the time when you say
you had this idea,

823
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:47,353
did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?

824
00:42:47,354 --> 00:42:48,855
"A family of means"?

825
00:42:48,856 --> 00:42:51,691
Did you know their father was wealthy?

826
00:42:51,692 --> 00:42:53,026
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.

827
00:42:53,027 --> 00:42:55,403
It's not important you be sure
why I'm asking.

828
00:42:55,404 --> 00:42:58,448
- It's not important to you.
- Sy.

829
00:42:58,449 --> 00:43:00,408
Did you know that they came from money?

830
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:02,410
I had no idea whether
they came from money or not.

831
00:43:02,411 --> 00:43:04,454
In one of your e-mails to Mr Narendra,

832
00:43:04,455 --> 00:43:07,915
you referenced Howard Winklevoss'
consulting firm.

833
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,250
If you say so.

834
00:43:09,251 --> 00:43:13,087
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose
assets are in the hundreds of millions.

835
00:43:13,088 --> 00:43:15,381
You also knew Tyler and Cameron
were members

836
00:43:15,382 --> 00:43:17,800
of a Harvard final club
called the Porcellian.

837
00:43:17,801 --> 00:43:19,135
They pointed that out.

838
00:43:19,136 --> 00:43:21,262
- Excuse us for inviting you in.
- To the bike room.

839
00:43:21,263 --> 00:43:26,263
Please. So it's safe to say you were aware
that my clients had money.

840
00:43:26,894 --> 00:43:27,977
Yes.

841
00:43:27,978 --> 00:43:29,479
Let me tell you why I'm asking.

842
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,982
I'm wondering why, if you needed $1,000
for an Internet venture,

843
00:43:32,983 --> 00:43:34,650
you didn't ask my clients for it.

844
00:43:34,651 --> 00:43:37,278
They had demonstrated an interest to you
in that kind of thing.

845
00:43:37,279 --> 00:43:40,448
I went to my friend for the money because
that's who I wanted to be partners with.

846
00:43:40,449 --> 00:43:42,992
Eduardo was the president of
the Harvard Investors Association,

847
00:43:42,993 --> 00:43:45,787
and he was also my best friend.

848
00:43:45,788 --> 00:43:49,957
Your best friend is suing you
for $600 million.

849
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:52,460
I didn't know that. Tell me more.

850
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:54,796
Eduardo, what happened
after the initial launch?

851
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:57,131
I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind
addressing him as Mr Saverin?

852
00:43:57,132 --> 00:43:58,841
- Gretchen, they're best friends.
- Not any more.

853
00:43:58,842 --> 00:44:00,968
Well, we already went through
this on the... Never mind.

854
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:03,679
Mr Saverin, what happened
after the initial launch?

855
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,181
It exploded.

856
00:44:05,182 --> 00:44:07,100
Everybody on campus was using it.

857
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:11,145
"Facebook me" was a common expression
after two weeks.

858
00:44:11,146 --> 00:44:12,271
And Mark?

859
00:44:12,272 --> 00:44:16,192
And Mark was the biggest thing on
a campus that included 19 Nobel laureates,

860
00:44:16,193 --> 00:44:20,863
15 Pulitzer Prize winners,
two future Olympians, and a movie star.

861
00:44:20,864 --> 00:44:22,532
Who was the movie star?

862
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:24,492
Does it matter?

863
00:44:24,493 --> 00:44:27,829
No.

864
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:31,707
At Out of Town News and picked up
that copy of Popular Electronics magazine

865
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:34,001
with the MITS Altair kit on the cover.

866
00:44:34,002 --> 00:44:36,587
It was a beautiful day
and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room.

867
00:44:36,588 --> 00:44:38,714
He brought that magazine up
and he showed it to me and he said,

868
00:44:38,715 --> 00:44:42,718
"Look, it's gonna happen without us.
We've gotta start now."

869
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,430
And I said, "Okay.
Let's get BASIC out there."

870
00:44:46,431 --> 00:44:49,392
Now, most of you think you know
the rest of the story, but you may not.

871
00:44:49,393 --> 00:44:51,769
The beginnings of this industry
were very humble.

872
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:56,107
That kit computer on the cover of
that magazine had an 8080 processor in it.

873
00:44:56,108 --> 00:45:00,778
Unless you paid extra for
a 1K memory board, you got 256 bytes.

874
00:45:00,779 --> 00:45:04,866
So the challenge when I wrote BASIC
wasn'tjust to run at 4 k-bytes,

875
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:09,867
but I also had to leave room for the users
to run their programs in 4 k-bytes.

876
00:45:10,914 --> 00:45:13,249
Your friend. Is that Mark Zuckerberg?

877
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,417
Yeah.

878
00:45:14,418 --> 00:45:16,919
- He made The Facebook.
- Yeah.

879
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,380
I mean, it's both of ours. We're...

880
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:21,299
Yeah, we... Yes.

881
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,758
Cool.

882
00:45:22,759 --> 00:45:24,302
I'm Christy Ling. This is Alice.

883
00:45:24,303 --> 00:45:25,428
Hi.

884
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:27,972
Well, very nice to meet you.

885
00:45:27,973 --> 00:45:29,599
Facebook me when you get home.

886
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,934
You know, maybe we can all go out
and grab a drink.

887
00:45:31,935 --> 00:45:33,102
Certainly.

888
00:45:33,103 --> 00:45:38,103
Absolutely do that.

889
00:45:41,737 --> 00:45:44,989
She said, "Facebook me
and we can all go for a drink later,"

890
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:46,616
which is stunningly great for two reasons.

891
00:45:46,617 --> 00:45:49,452
One, she said "facebook me," right?
And then the other is, well, you know...

892
00:45:49,453 --> 00:45:50,578
They wanna have drinks later.

893
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:52,288
Yes, have you ever heard
so many different good things

894
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:53,915
packed into one regular-sized sentence?

895
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:56,125
Excuse me, Mark?

896
00:45:56,126 --> 00:45:57,293
Yeah?

897
00:45:57,294 --> 00:45:59,795
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your OS lab.

898
00:45:59,796 --> 00:46:01,339
Sure.

899
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,299
- Awesome job with The Facebook.
- Awesome job.

900
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,425
Thanks.

901
00:46:04,426 --> 00:46:06,302
- I'm Bob.
- How you doing?

902
00:46:06,303 --> 00:46:07,803
You know, I could swear
he was looking at you

903
00:46:07,804 --> 00:46:11,140
when he said the next Bill Gates
could be right in this room.

904
00:46:11,141 --> 00:46:12,683
I doubt it.

905
00:46:12,684 --> 00:46:16,646
And I showed up late.
I don't even know who the speaker was.

906
00:46:16,647 --> 00:46:19,398
It was Bill Gates.

907
00:46:19,399 --> 00:46:22,235
Shit, that makes sense.

908
00:46:22,236 --> 00:46:26,822
All right. Thanks, guys.

909
00:46:26,823 --> 00:46:28,658
- Are you a moron?
- Are you medically stupid?

910
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:30,409
You can't tell Bill Gates
is in front of you for an hour?

911
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,328
I wasn't wearing my Contacts.

912
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:36,332
Can I get a Glock and kill you?

913
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:38,000
It's time to monetise the thing.

914
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:39,377
What were their names?

915
00:46:39,378 --> 00:46:41,254
- Hear what I just said?
- When?

916
00:46:41,255 --> 00:46:44,340
I said it's time to monetise the site.

917
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:45,424
What does that mean?

918
00:46:45,425 --> 00:46:48,344
It means it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.

919
00:46:48,345 --> 00:46:52,014
No, I know what the word means.
I'm asking how you wanna do it.

920
00:46:52,015 --> 00:46:54,100
- Advertising.
- No.

921
00:46:54,101 --> 00:46:56,352
Well, we got 4,000 members.

922
00:46:56,353 --> 00:46:57,561
'Cause The Facebook is cool,

923
00:46:57,562 --> 00:47:00,856
and if we start installing pop-ups
for Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool.

924
00:47:00,857 --> 00:47:02,566
Well, Iwasn't thinking Mountain Dew,
but at some point,

925
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:05,111
and I'm talking as the business end
of the company, the site...

926
00:47:05,112 --> 00:47:08,406
We don't even know what it is yet.
We don't know what it is.

927
00:47:08,407 --> 00:47:10,950
We don't know what it can be.
We don't know what it will be.

928
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:12,368
We know that it is cool.

929
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:14,704
That is a priceless asset
I'm not giving up.

930
00:47:14,705 --> 00:47:16,956
- So when will it be finished?
- It won't be finished.

931
00:47:16,957 --> 00:47:18,749
That's the point.
The way fashion's never finished.

932
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,127
- What?
- Fashion. Fashion is never finished.

933
00:47:21,128 --> 00:47:22,712
You're talking about fashion? Really, you?

934
00:47:22,713 --> 00:47:25,381
I'm talking about the idea of it
and I'm saying that it's never finished.

935
00:47:25,382 --> 00:47:29,969
Okay. But they manage
to make money selling pants.

936
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:31,554
Mark, what is this?

937
00:47:31,555 --> 00:47:33,097
- What?
- This.

938
00:47:33,098 --> 00:47:35,474
It's called a cease-and-desist letter.
What were their names?

939
00:47:35,475 --> 00:47:36,600
- Who?
- The girls.

940
00:47:36,601 --> 00:47:37,893
When did you get this?

941
00:47:37,894 --> 00:47:40,062
About 10 days ago.
Right after we launched the site.

942
00:47:40,063 --> 00:47:41,981
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, the girls. What were their names?

943
00:47:41,982 --> 00:47:45,234
The Winklevoss twins are saying
that you stole their idea.

944
00:47:45,235 --> 00:47:47,653
I find that to be a little more
than mildly annoying.

945
00:47:47,654 --> 00:47:50,990
Oh, well, they find it to be
intellectual property theft.

946
00:47:50,991 --> 00:47:52,283
- Look...
- Why didn't you show this to me?

947
00:47:52,284 --> 00:47:53,909
It was addressed to me.

948
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:57,079
They're saying that we stole The Facebook
from Divya Narendra and the Winklevosses.

949
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,248
- I know what it says.
- Did we?

950
00:47:59,249 --> 00:48:00,333
Did we what?

951
00:48:00,334 --> 00:48:02,585
Don't screw around with me now.
Look at me.

952
00:48:02,586 --> 00:48:04,337
The letter says we could face legal action.

953
00:48:04,338 --> 00:48:06,088
No, it says I could face legal action.

954
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:08,424
This is from a lawyer, Mark.
They must feel they have some grounds.

955
00:48:08,425 --> 00:48:11,635
- The lawyer is their father's house counsel.
- Do they have grounds?

956
00:48:11,636 --> 00:48:13,137
The grounds are
our thing is cool and popular,

957
00:48:13,138 --> 00:48:14,638
and Harvard Connection is lame.

958
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:16,974
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code,
I promise.

959
00:48:16,975 --> 00:48:18,100
I didn't use anything.

960
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:20,019
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair
doesn't owe money

961
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,771
to everyone who ever
has built a chair, okay?

962
00:48:21,772 --> 00:48:23,647
They came to me with an idea,
I had a better one.

963
00:48:23,648 --> 00:48:28,648
- Why didn't you show me this letter?
- I didn't think it was a big deal.

964
00:48:28,695 --> 00:48:31,155
<i>Okay-</i>

965
00:48:31,156 --> 00:48:36,156
So if there's something wrong, if there's
ever anything wrong, you can tell me.

966
00:48:37,037 --> 00:48:39,580
I'm the guy that wants to help.
This is our thing.

967
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:43,501
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me?

968
00:48:43,502 --> 00:48:44,002
No.

969
00:48:47,881 --> 00:48:49,507
What are we doing about this?

970
00:48:49,508 --> 00:48:53,010
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services
and he told me to write them back.

971
00:48:53,011 --> 00:48:54,261
And what did you say?

972
00:48:54,262 --> 00:48:57,473
"When we met in January,
I expressed my doubts about the site."

973
00:48:57,474 --> 00:48:59,934
"Where it stood with graphics,
how much programming was left"

974
00:48:59,935 --> 00:49:01,435
"that I had not anticipated."

975
00:49:01,436 --> 00:49:03,771
"The lack of hardware
we had to deal with site use,"

976
00:49:03,772 --> 00:49:07,108
"the lack of promotion that would go on
to successfully launch the website."

977
00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:10,778
This was the first time you raised
any of those concerns, right?

978
00:49:10,779 --> 00:49:12,488
I'd raised concerns before.

979
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:13,823
- Bullshit.
- Not to us.

980
00:49:13,824 --> 00:49:17,952
Gentlemen, I'm talking about at the meeting
in January to which this letter is referring.

981
00:49:17,953 --> 00:49:19,078
Yeah.

982
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:21,247
Let me rephrase this.

983
00:49:21,248 --> 00:49:25,793
You sent my client 16 e-mails. In the
first 15 you didn't raise any concerns.

984
00:49:25,794 --> 00:49:26,961
Is that a question?

985
00:49:26,962 --> 00:49:30,589
In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns
about the site's functionality.

986
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:33,426
- Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.

987
00:49:33,427 --> 00:49:36,595
Then why didn't you raise
any of these concerns before?

988
00:49:36,596 --> 00:49:38,556
- It's raining.
- I'm sorry?

989
00:49:38,557 --> 00:49:39,890
It just started raining.

990
00:49:39,891 --> 00:49:43,811
Mr Zuckerberg,
do I have your full attention?

991
00:49:43,812 --> 00:49:45,980
No.

992
00:49:45,981 --> 00:49:47,648
Do you think I deserve it?

993
00:49:47,649 --> 00:49:48,774
What?

994
00:49:48,775 --> 00:49:52,278
Do you think I deserve your full attention?

995
00:49:52,279 --> 00:49:54,405
I had to swear an oath
before we began this deposition

996
00:49:54,406 --> 00:49:57,616
and I don't wanna perjure myself,
so I have a legal obligation to say no.

997
00:49:57,617 --> 00:50:01,495
Okay. No.
You don't think I deserve your attention?

998
00:50:01,496 --> 00:50:04,623
I think if your clients wanna sit on
my shoulders and call themselves tall,

999
00:50:04,624 --> 00:50:05,833
they have a right to give it a try,

1000
00:50:05,834 --> 00:50:10,337
but there's no requirement that I enjoy
sitting here listening to people lie.

1001
00:50:10,338 --> 00:50:13,507
You have part of my attention.
You have the minimum amount.

1002
00:50:13,508 --> 00:50:16,051
The rest of my attention is
back at the offices of Facebook,

1003
00:50:16,052 --> 00:50:18,429
where my colleagues and I are doing things
that no one in this room,

1004
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:20,097
including and especially your clients,

1005
00:50:20,098 --> 00:50:24,310
are intellectually or creatively
capable of doing.

1006
00:50:24,311 --> 00:50:29,311
Did I adequately answer
your condescending question?

1007
00:50:34,321 --> 00:50:39,321
Well, I have 12:45.
Why don't we say that's lunch?

1008
00:50:39,701 --> 00:50:42,077
Back at 2:30.

1009
00:50:42,078 --> 00:50:45,748
So what were their names?

1010
00:50:45,749 --> 00:50:50,419
Their names were Christy and Alice,

1011
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:55,257
and they wanna have drinks tonight.

1012
00:50:55,258 --> 00:51:00,258
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is a men's room.

1013
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:03,099
Wow.

1014
00:51:17,781 --> 00:51:20,115
Oh, my God.

1015
00:51:20,116 --> 00:51:25,116
I don't care.

1016
00:51:43,598 --> 00:51:45,891
Hey, man, sorry.

1017
00:51:45,892 --> 00:51:48,978
A couple girls are freshening up in there.

1018
00:51:48,979 --> 00:51:49,479
Sweet.

1019
00:51:54,651 --> 00:51:59,651
We have groupies.

1020
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:06,245
I'll be right back.

1021
00:52:06,246 --> 00:52:11,246
Mark, where you going? Mark.

1022
00:52:13,295 --> 00:52:16,255
Enca?

1023
00:52:16,256 --> 00:52:17,381
Hi.

1024
00:52:17,382 --> 00:52:20,092
I saw you from over there.
I didn't know you came to this club a lot.

1025
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:22,469
- First time.
- Mine, too.

1026
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:25,014
Could I talk to you alone for a second?

1027
00:52:25,015 --> 00:52:26,307
I think I'm good right here.

1028
00:52:26,308 --> 00:52:30,436
I just... I'd love to talk to you alone
if we could just go someplace.

1029
00:52:30,437 --> 00:52:32,438
Right here is fine.

1030
00:52:32,439 --> 00:52:34,565
I don't know if you heard about
this new website I launched.

1031
00:52:34,566 --> 00:52:36,483
No.

1032
00:52:36,484 --> 00:52:39,320
- The Facebook?
- You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark.

1033
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:41,238
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1034
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:43,324
- On the Internet.
- That's why I came over.

1035
00:52:43,325 --> 00:52:45,451
Comparing women to farm animals.

1036
00:52:45,452 --> 00:52:46,994
I didn't end up doing that.

1037
00:52:46,995 --> 00:52:48,746
It didn't stop you from writing it.

1038
00:52:48,747 --> 00:52:51,415
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head was so clever

1039
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:55,294
it would be a crime for
it not to be shared.

1040
00:52:55,295 --> 00:52:57,921
The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark,
it's written in ink,

1041
00:52:57,922 --> 00:53:00,924
and you published that Erica Albright
was a bitch,

1042
00:53:00,925 --> 00:53:05,387
right before you made some ignorant crack
about my family's name, my bra size,

1043
00:53:05,388 --> 00:53:08,474
and then rated women
based on their hotness.

1044
00:53:08,475 --> 00:53:11,602
- Erica, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

1045
00:53:11,603 --> 00:53:13,729
You write your snide bullshit
from a dark room

1046
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:17,483
because that's what the angry do nowadays.

1047
00:53:17,484 --> 00:53:19,652
I was nice to you. Don't torture me for it.

1048
00:53:19,653 --> 00:53:21,695
If we could just go
somewhere for a minute...

1049
00:53:21,696 --> 00:53:23,989
I don't wanna be rude to my friends.

1050
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,240
<i>Okay-</i>

1051
00:53:25,241 --> 00:53:28,202
<i>Okay-</i>

1052
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:30,663
Good luck with your video game.

1053
00:53:30,664 --> 00:53:32,665
Hey, that was great.
That was the right thing to do.

1054
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:37,378
You apologised, right?

1055
00:53:37,379 --> 00:53:38,671
We have to expand.

1056
00:53:38,672 --> 00:53:42,549
Sure. Mark?

1057
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:45,094
Is he mad about something?

1058
00:53:45,095 --> 00:53:47,346
Okay, we are expanding
to Yale and Columbia.

1059
00:53:47,347 --> 00:53:49,139
Dustin, I want you to share
the coding work with me.

1060
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,016
Chris, you're gonna be in charge
of publicity and outreach,

1061
00:53:51,017 --> 00:53:53,310
and you could start by getting a story
in the BU student newspaper.

1062
00:53:53,311 --> 00:53:54,436
<i>It's The Bridge.</i>

1063
00:53:54,437 --> 00:53:55,771
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

1064
00:53:55,772 --> 00:53:57,773
Somebody at the newspaper
will be a computer science major.

1065
00:53:57,774 --> 00:54:00,275
Tell them that Mark Zuckerberg
will do 10 hours of free programming.

1066
00:54:00,276 --> 00:54:02,069
Why do you want a story
in the BU newspaper?

1067
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,362
Because I do. Now here's the arrangement.

1068
00:54:03,363 --> 00:54:05,447
Eduardo is CFO
and owns 30% of the company.

1069
00:54:05,448 --> 00:54:07,074
Dustin is vice president
and head of programming,

1070
00:54:07,075 --> 00:54:09,743
and his 5% of the company
will come from my end.

1071
00:54:09,744 --> 00:54:11,120
Chris is director of publicity,

1072
00:54:11,121 --> 00:54:13,580
and his compensation will depend on
how much work he ends up doing.

1073
00:54:13,581 --> 00:54:14,707
Any questions?

1074
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:18,502
- Who are the girls?
- Sorry. They're Christy and Alice.

1075
00:54:18,503 --> 00:54:19,753
- Hi.
- Hi.

1076
00:54:19,754 --> 00:54:21,672
- Hello.
- Hi.

1077
00:54:21,673 --> 00:54:23,173
Is there anything we can do?

1078
00:54:23,174 --> 00:54:24,341
No, that's it.

1079
00:54:24,342 --> 00:54:27,386
- Yale and Columbia, let's go.
- And Stanford.

1080
00:54:27,387 --> 00:54:29,471
- What?
- Stanford.

1081
00:54:29,472 --> 00:54:34,472
It's time for them to
see this in Palo Alto.

1082
00:54:37,564 --> 00:54:38,981
You don't want any lunch?

1083
00:54:38,982 --> 00:54:40,482
No.

1084
00:54:40,483 --> 00:54:42,234
You're welcome to some salad.

1085
00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:47,235
No, thank you.

1086
00:54:50,076 --> 00:54:52,661
This must be hard.

1087
00:54:52,662 --> 00:54:54,246
Who are you?

1088
00:54:54,247 --> 00:54:56,874
I'm Marylin Delpy.
I introduced myself when we first...

1089
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:58,333
I mean, what do you do?

1090
00:54:58,334 --> 00:55:00,544
I'm a second-year associate at the firm.

1091
00:55:00,545 --> 00:55:04,757
My boss wanted me to sit in
on the deposition phase.

1092
00:55:04,758 --> 00:55:06,008
What are you doing?

1093
00:55:06,009 --> 00:55:09,094
Checking in to see how
it's going in Bosnia.

1094
00:55:09,095 --> 00:55:10,554
Bosnia.

1095
00:55:10,555 --> 00:55:15,555
They don't have roads,
but they have Facebook.

1096
00:55:18,563 --> 00:55:22,149
You must really hate the Winklevosses.

1097
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,651
I don't hate anybody.

1098
00:55:24,652 --> 00:55:27,988
The Winklevi aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.

1099
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:30,616
They are suing me because
for the first time in their lives,

1100
00:55:30,617 --> 00:55:35,617
things didn't work out the way
they were supposed to for them.

1101
00:55:40,502 --> 00:55:42,336
He's expanding.

1102
00:55:42,337 --> 00:55:43,504
What?

1103
00:55:43,505 --> 00:55:45,130
He's expanding
to Yale, Columbia and Stanford.

1104
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:46,256
<i>It's</i> gonna <i>be</i> in <i>The Crimson tomorrow.</i>

1105
00:55:46,257 --> 00:55:47,424
- Really?
- Yep.

1106
00:55:47,425 --> 00:55:50,719
Well, looks like that cease-and-desist letter
really scared the shit out of him, huh?

1107
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,097
I wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive
relief and get the site taken down now.

1108
00:55:54,098 --> 00:55:57,142
Every minute the site is up,
Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.

1109
00:55:57,143 --> 00:56:00,020
I want an injunction. I want damages.
I want punitive relief.

1110
00:56:00,021 --> 00:56:01,146
And I want him dead.

1111
00:56:01,147 --> 00:56:02,314
Yeah, I want those things, too.

1112
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:03,690
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?

1113
00:56:03,691 --> 00:56:05,067
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?

1114
00:56:05,068 --> 00:56:06,860
No, it's because you're not thinking
how it's gonna look.

1115
00:56:06,861 --> 00:56:07,986
How's it gonna look?

1116
00:56:07,987 --> 00:56:09,279
Like my brother and I
are in skeleton costumes

1117
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,657
chasing the Karate Kid
around a high school gym.

1118
00:56:11,658 --> 00:56:15,327
Cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law.

1119
00:56:15,328 --> 00:56:17,246
When he goes to Connecticut,
New York and California,

1120
00:56:17,247 --> 00:56:18,664
he'll have violated federal law.

1121
00:56:18,665 --> 00:56:20,541
And, by the way,
he's in violation of Harvard law.

1122
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:22,543
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1123
00:56:22,544 --> 00:56:27,544
Wait. Yeah, there is.

1124
00:56:30,093 --> 00:56:31,552
Harvard Student Handbook.

1125
00:56:31,553 --> 00:56:34,429
Every freshman is issued one of these,
and somewhere in this book it says...

1126
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:37,808
You can't steal from another student.

1127
00:56:37,809 --> 00:56:39,643
This is what we needed.
We're going to Summers.

1128
00:56:39,644 --> 00:56:41,895
Well, you can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.

1129
00:56:41,896 --> 00:56:43,522
My brother and I,
we pay tuition at this school.

1130
00:56:43,523 --> 00:56:46,817
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school.
We've won trophies for this school.

1131
00:56:46,818 --> 00:56:49,361
And we'll be rowing in the Olympics
for this school.

1132
00:56:49,362 --> 00:56:52,906
I want a meeting with
the goddamn president of this school.

1133
00:56:52,907 --> 00:56:54,533
Why Stanford?

1134
00:56:54,534 --> 00:56:59,534
Why do you think?

1135
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,124
I'm sorry.

1136
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:05,127
I'm late for biochem.

1137
00:57:05,128 --> 00:57:09,089
<i>Okay-</i>

1138
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,091
You don't know my name, do you?

1139
00:57:11,092 --> 00:57:12,801
Is it Stanford?

1140
00:57:12,802 --> 00:57:14,970
I should just kick your ass.

1141
00:57:14,971 --> 00:57:17,264
How do you go to a party
and you meet someone...

1142
00:57:17,265 --> 00:57:20,559
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy.
You're from Orinda.

1143
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:24,146
Your father's in commercial real estate
and your mother's 10 years sober.

1144
00:57:24,147 --> 00:57:25,898
What's my major?

1145
00:57:25,899 --> 00:57:28,108
- Trombone.
- Really?

1146
00:57:28,109 --> 00:57:33,109
I remember something about a trombone.

1147
00:57:33,781 --> 00:57:35,157
French.

1148
00:57:35,158 --> 00:57:36,325
Your major's French.

1149
00:57:36,326 --> 00:57:38,118
- And yours?
- Mine?

1150
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:41,496
- I don't have one.
- You haven't declared?

1151
00:57:41,497 --> 00:57:42,831
I don't go to school.

1152
00:57:42,832 --> 00:57:45,000
- You're kidding.
- No.

1153
00:57:45,001 --> 00:57:47,085
Well, where did you go to school?

1154
00:57:47,086 --> 00:57:49,504
William Taft Elementary,
for a little while.

1155
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:51,256
Seriously?

1156
00:57:51,257 --> 00:57:54,176
You're not like 15 years old or anything,
are you?

1157
00:57:54,177 --> 00:57:56,011
No.

1158
00:57:56,012 --> 00:57:57,179
Wait, you're not like 15, are you?

1159
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,973
No.

1160
00:57:59,974 --> 00:58:02,684
So, what do you do?

1161
00:58:02,685 --> 00:58:04,353
I'm an entrepreneur.

1162
00:58:04,354 --> 00:58:06,939
- You're unemployed.
- I wouldn't say that.

1163
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,148
What would you say?

1164
00:58:08,149 --> 00:58:09,358
That I'm an entrepreneur.

1165
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,151
Well, then, what was your latest preneur?

1166
00:58:11,152 --> 00:58:15,864
Well, I founded an Internet company that let
folks download and share music for free.

1167
00:58:15,865 --> 00:58:17,282
Kind of like Napster?

1168
00:58:17,283 --> 00:58:18,825
Exactly like Napster.

1169
00:58:18,826 --> 00:58:20,535
What do you mean?

1170
00:58:20,536 --> 00:58:21,954
I founded Napster.

1171
00:58:21,955 --> 00:58:24,039
Sean Parker founded Napster.

1172
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,457
Nice to meet you.

1173
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,459
You're Sean Parker?

1174
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,336
You see, the shoe's on the other...

1175
00:58:29,337 --> 00:58:32,673
- Foot?
- Table, which has turned.

1176
00:58:32,674 --> 00:58:34,299
I just slept with Sean Parker?

1177
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:36,385
You just slept on Sean Parker.

1178
00:58:36,386 --> 00:58:38,720
- You're a zillionaire.
- Not technically.

1179
00:58:38,721 --> 00:58:40,889
What are you?

1180
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:42,641
Broke. There's not
a lot of money in free music,

1181
00:58:42,642 --> 00:58:46,061
even less when you're being sued by
everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.

1182
00:58:46,062 --> 00:58:47,646
This is blowing my mind.

1183
00:58:47,647 --> 00:58:48,730
I appreciate that.

1184
00:58:48,731 --> 00:58:50,691
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.

1185
00:58:50,692 --> 00:58:54,569
Biochem, even though you're
a French major whose name is Amy.

1186
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:56,196
You passed.

1187
00:58:56,197 --> 00:58:58,824
I'm a hard worker.

1188
00:58:58,825 --> 00:59:02,703
There's juice or anything else you can find.
Help yourself.

1189
00:59:02,704 --> 00:59:04,329
You mind if I check my e-mail?

1190
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:09,330
Yeah, go ahead.

1191
00:59:15,925 --> 00:59:19,261
Amy!

1192
00:59:19,262 --> 00:59:20,554
Jesus.

1193
00:59:20,555 --> 00:59:23,724
- Amy! Can you come out here?
- Yeah?

1194
00:59:23,725 --> 00:59:28,228
Just a second.

1195
00:59:28,229 --> 00:59:29,771
There's a snake in here, Amy.

1196
00:59:29,772 --> 00:59:33,275
What?

1197
00:59:33,276 --> 00:59:34,443
Where?

1198
00:59:34,444 --> 00:59:35,944
There isn't a snake,
but I need to ask you something.

1199
00:59:35,945 --> 00:59:38,071
Are you kidding me? I could've been killed.

1200
00:59:38,072 --> 00:59:39,281
How?

1201
00:59:39,282 --> 00:59:43,243
By running too fast
and getting twisted in the curtain.

1202
00:59:43,244 --> 00:59:44,911
What do you need to ask me?

1203
00:59:44,912 --> 00:59:48,582
Yeah, I went to check my e-mail and
there's a website open on your computer.

1204
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:52,127
Yeah, after you passed out last night
I went on The Facebook for a little bit.

1205
00:59:52,128 --> 00:59:54,421
- What's that?
- The Facebook?

1206
00:59:54,422 --> 00:59:57,591
Stanfords had it for, like, two weeks now.

1207
00:59:57,592 --> 01:00:00,802
It's really awesome,
except it's freakishly addictive.

1208
01:00:00,803 --> 01:00:03,221
Seriously, I'm on the thing
like five times a day.

1209
01:00:03,222 --> 01:00:04,806
Mind if I send myself an e-mail?

1210
01:00:04,807 --> 01:00:06,433
Yeah, is everything okay?

1211
01:00:06,434 --> 01:00:08,977
Everything's great.

1212
01:00:08,978 --> 01:00:13,978
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.

1213
01:00:17,153 --> 01:00:18,820
I've never been in this building before.

1214
01:00:18,821 --> 01:00:23,821
This building's 100 years older
than the country it's in, so do be careful.

1215
01:00:24,494 --> 01:00:26,995
We're sitting in chairs.

1216
01:00:26,996 --> 01:00:28,997
Yes.

1217
01:00:28,998 --> 01:00:33,998
Very good. You can go in now.

1218
01:00:35,797 --> 01:00:38,673
That's their own stupidity.
I should've been there.

1219
01:00:38,674 --> 01:00:40,342
Well, darkness is the absence of light,

1220
01:00:40,343 --> 01:00:43,303
and the stupidity in that instance
was the absence of me.

1221
01:00:43,304 --> 01:00:45,305
Catherine, I've got students
in my office now.

1222
01:00:45,306 --> 01:00:47,766
Students. Undergrads.

1223
01:00:47,767 --> 01:00:48,850
I don't know.

1224
01:00:48,851 --> 01:00:51,686
From the looks of it, they want
to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.

1225
01:00:51,687 --> 01:00:53,814
All right, bye-bye.

1226
01:00:53,815 --> 01:00:54,940
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

1227
01:00:54,941 --> 01:00:56,942
I'm Cameron Winklevoss
and this is my brother, Tyler.

1228
01:00:56,943 --> 01:01:00,487
And you're here because...

1229
01:01:00,488 --> 01:01:01,613
Either of you can answer.

1230
01:01:01,614 --> 01:01:03,198
I'm sorry, sir,
I thought you were reading the letter.

1231
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:04,366
I've read the letter.

1232
01:01:04,367 --> 01:01:07,702
Well, we came up with an idea for
a website called Harvard Connection...

1233
01:01:07,703 --> 01:01:10,997
we've since changed the name to ConnectU.
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...

1234
01:01:10,998 --> 01:01:12,499
I understand.

1235
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,043
And I'm asking what you want me
to do about it.

1236
01:01:15,044 --> 01:01:19,047
Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman,

1237
01:01:19,048 --> 01:01:21,842
under the heading "Standards of Conduct
in the Harvard Community,"

1238
01:01:21,843 --> 01:01:25,220
it says the college expects all students
to be honest and forthcoming

1239
01:01:25,221 --> 01:01:27,722
in their dealings with members
in this community.

1240
01:01:27,723 --> 01:01:30,851
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership,

1241
01:01:30,852 --> 01:01:32,853
and instances of theft,
misappropriation or...

1242
01:01:32,854 --> 01:01:34,396
- Anne?
- Yes, sir?

1243
01:01:34,397 --> 01:01:39,192
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.

1244
01:01:39,193 --> 01:01:43,238
Or unauthorised use
will result in disciplinary action,

1245
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:45,323
including the requirement
to withdraw from the college.

1246
01:01:45,324 --> 01:01:47,534
And you memorised that
instead of doing what?

1247
01:01:47,535 --> 01:01:51,037
What my brother and I came here today
to ask of you, respectfully, of course...

1248
01:01:51,038 --> 01:01:54,249
Sir, it's against university rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.

1249
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:55,584
And you've spoken to your House Master?

1250
01:01:55,585 --> 01:01:58,044
Yes, sir. And the House Master made
a recommendation to the Ad Board,

1251
01:01:58,045 --> 01:01:59,713
but the Ad Board won't see us.

1252
01:01:59,714 --> 01:02:01,590
Have you tried dealing with
the other student directly?

1253
01:02:01,591 --> 01:02:04,551
Mr Zuckerberg hasn't been responding
to any of our e-mails or phone calls

1254
01:02:04,552 --> 01:02:05,719
for the last two weeks.

1255
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,596
He doesn't answer when
we knock on his door at Kirkland,

1256
01:02:07,597 --> 01:02:09,556
and the closest I've come
to dealing with him face-to-face

1257
01:02:09,557 --> 01:02:11,933
is when I saw him on the quad
and chased him through Harvard Square.

1258
01:02:11,934 --> 01:02:13,101
You chased him?

1259
01:02:13,102 --> 01:02:16,563
I saw him and I know he saw me.
I went after him and then he disappeared.

1260
01:02:16,564 --> 01:02:19,941
- I don't see this as a university issue.
- Of course this is a university issue.

1261
01:02:19,942 --> 01:02:22,444
There's a code of ethics and an honour code
and he violated them both.

1262
01:02:22,445 --> 01:02:26,740
You enter into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.

1263
01:02:26,741 --> 01:02:30,035
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what
you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1264
01:02:30,036 --> 01:02:31,286
I'm devastated by that.

1265
01:02:31,287 --> 01:02:34,039
What my brother means is, if
Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room

1266
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,291
and stole our computer,
that would be a university issue.

1267
01:02:36,292 --> 01:02:38,710
I really don't know.
This office doesn't handle petty larceny.

1268
01:02:38,711 --> 01:02:40,128
This isn't petty larceny.

1269
01:02:40,129 --> 01:02:42,422
This idea is potentially worth
millions of dollars.

1270
01:02:42,423 --> 01:02:43,632
- Millions?
- Yes.

1271
01:02:43,633 --> 01:02:46,301
You mightjust be letting
your imaginations run away with you.

1272
01:02:46,302 --> 01:02:49,221
Sir, I honestly don't think you're
in any position to make that call.

1273
01:02:49,222 --> 01:02:53,600
I was the US Treasury Secretary.
I'm in some position to make that call.

1274
01:02:53,601 --> 01:02:54,976
Letting our imaginations run away with us

1275
01:02:54,977 --> 01:02:56,978
is exactly what we were told to do
in your freshman address.

1276
01:02:56,979 --> 01:03:00,065
Well, then I would suggest
that you let your imaginations

1277
01:03:00,066 --> 01:03:01,483
run away with you on a new project.

1278
01:03:01,484 --> 01:03:02,734
You would?

1279
01:03:02,735 --> 01:03:04,277
Yes. Everyone at Harvard's
inventing something.

1280
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:09,278
Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing
a job is better than finding a job.

1281
01:03:09,283 --> 01:03:12,827
So I'll suggest again that the two of you
come up with a new new project.

1282
01:03:12,828 --> 01:03:15,997
- I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.
- Please, arrive at the point.

1283
01:03:15,998 --> 01:03:17,832
You don't have to be
an intellectual property expert

1284
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,459
to understand the difference
between right and wrong.

1285
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,336
And you're saying that I don't?

1286
01:03:21,337 --> 01:03:23,421
- Of course I'm not saying that, sir.
- I'm saying that.

1287
01:03:23,422 --> 01:03:25,340
- Really?
- Sir.

1288
01:03:25,341 --> 01:03:27,342
Anne, how did they get this appointment?

1289
01:03:27,343 --> 01:03:30,804
Colleagues of their father.

1290
01:03:30,805 --> 01:03:33,181
Let me tell you something,
Mr Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,

1291
01:03:33,182 --> 01:03:35,684
since you're on the subject
of right and wrong.

1292
01:03:35,685 --> 01:03:40,188
This action, this meeting,
the two of you being here is wrong.

1293
01:03:40,189 --> 01:03:43,608
It's not worthy of Harvard.
It's not what Harvard saw in you.

1294
01:03:43,609 --> 01:03:46,194
You don't get special treatment.

1295
01:03:46,195 --> 01:03:48,697
- We never asked...
- Just start another project?

1296
01:03:48,698 --> 01:03:50,657
Like we're making a diorama
for a science fair?

1297
01:03:50,658 --> 01:03:52,200
If you have a problem
with that, Mr Winklevoss...

1298
01:03:52,201 --> 01:03:53,368
We never asked for special treatment.

1299
01:03:53,369 --> 01:03:57,163
The courts are always at your disposal.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

1300
01:03:57,164 --> 01:03:58,873
You can take the Harvard
Student Handbook and shove it...

1301
01:03:58,874 --> 01:04:00,625
Ty.

1302
01:04:00,626 --> 01:04:05,626
Thank you very much for your time, sir.

1303
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:09,551
Whoops.

1304
01:04:09,552 --> 01:04:13,680
Broke your 335-year-0ld doorknob.

1305
01:04:13,681 --> 01:04:16,891
Eduardo, spring break, you
and Mr Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1306
01:04:16,892 --> 01:04:19,561
- Yes.
- What was the purpose of the trip?

1307
01:04:19,562 --> 01:04:24,024
Well, as CFO, I had set up some meetings
with potential advertisers.

1308
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:25,150
Who paid for the trip?

1309
01:04:25,151 --> 01:04:28,361
It was paid for out of the $1,000 account
I had set up a few months earlier.

1310
01:04:28,362 --> 01:04:32,240
At this point, your $1,000 was the only
money that had been put into the company?

1311
01:04:32,241 --> 01:04:35,744
- Yes.
- How did you feel the meetings went?

1312
01:04:35,745 --> 01:04:38,038
- They went terribly.
- Why?

1313
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:39,247
Mark was asleep.

1314
01:04:39,248 --> 01:04:40,749
I was not asleep.

1315
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,250
Can I rephrase my answer?

1316
01:04:42,251 --> 01:04:47,047
I wish he'd been asleep.

1317
01:04:47,048 --> 01:04:51,384
So we're in 29 schools now,
with over 75,000 members.

1318
01:04:51,385 --> 01:04:52,594
People who go on The Facebook

1319
01:04:52,595 --> 01:04:55,096
tend to stay on longer
than almost any other website.

1320
01:04:55,097 --> 01:04:56,931
Now, here's the most impressive statistic.

1321
01:04:56,932 --> 01:05:00,018
91% of people who try it once
will come back.

1322
01:05:00,019 --> 01:05:02,020
- Now, if you'll allow me...
- Excuse me one second.

1323
01:05:02,021 --> 01:05:07,021
What sound is he making?
Is that like a tsk?

1324
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,194
It wasn't a tsk.

1325
01:05:09,195 --> 01:05:11,446
It was...

1326
01:05:11,447 --> 01:05:13,782
Like a glottal stop.

1327
01:05:13,783 --> 01:05:17,202
Almost a gag reflex.

1328
01:05:17,203 --> 01:05:19,037
Guys, what is this?

1329
01:05:19,038 --> 01:05:21,790
There was one more meeting scheduled
for the New York trip.

1330
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:23,208
Yes, it was a dinner.

1331
01:05:23,209 --> 01:05:24,793
It was set up through
my girlfriend at the time.

1332
01:05:24,794 --> 01:05:27,879
Would you say that Mark was
excited about this meeting?

1333
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,215
Yes. Very.

1334
01:05:30,216 --> 01:05:32,300
- Look, they're not gonna card us.
- They might.

1335
01:05:32,301 --> 01:05:34,260
- I mean, look around.
- It'll be embarrassing.

1336
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:37,138
- Tell him they're not gonna card us.
- They're not gonna card us.

1337
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:39,140
- Mark...
- Are you gonna talk about ads again?

1338
01:05:39,141 --> 01:05:40,975
Unless you're the ballet
theatre of Hartford,

1339
01:05:40,976 --> 01:05:43,061
the purpose of a business
is to make a profit.

1340
01:05:43,062 --> 01:05:44,312
It isn't a business yet.

1341
01:05:44,313 --> 01:05:49,313
That's tough for me, 'cause my...
Never mind.

1342
01:05:51,112 --> 01:05:52,570
He's 25 minutes late.

1343
01:05:52,571 --> 01:05:55,448
He founded Napster when he was 19.
He can be late.

1344
01:05:55,449 --> 01:05:57,158
- He's not a god.
- Then what is he?

1345
01:05:57,159 --> 01:05:58,743
He's 25 minutes late.

1346
01:05:58,744 --> 01:06:00,161
I think Wardo's jealous.

1347
01:06:00,162 --> 01:06:03,498
I honestly wasn'tjealous. I was nervous.

1348
01:06:03,499 --> 01:06:04,624
Why?

1349
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:08,169
Well, I didn't know him at all, but I had
done a search and I'd asked around.

1350
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:13,170
And he struck me as kind of a...

1351
01:06:13,342 --> 01:06:15,009
A wild card.

1352
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:16,136
Why?

1353
01:06:16,137 --> 01:06:19,514
He crashed out of two pretty big
Internet companies in spectacular fashion,

1354
01:06:19,515 --> 01:06:21,015
he's had a reputation with drugs...

1355
01:06:21,016 --> 01:06:22,350
He also founded the companies.

1356
01:06:22,351 --> 01:06:24,310
We don't need him.

1357
01:06:24,311 --> 01:06:28,523
He's here.

1358
01:06:28,524 --> 01:06:30,191
No, no, take your time.

1359
01:06:30,192 --> 01:06:34,821
- And he does own a watch.
- Stop it.

1360
01:06:34,822 --> 01:06:36,114
- I'm Sean Parker.
- How do you do?

1361
01:06:36,115 --> 01:06:39,159
You must be Eduardo. And Christy.
And Mark.

1362
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,202
- Great to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

1363
01:06:41,203 --> 01:06:42,829
You guys don't have anything
in front of you.

1364
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:43,955
- No.
- Tori.

1365
01:06:43,956 --> 01:06:45,039
We were waiting.

1366
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,333
- Hey, baby boy.
- Can you bring out some things?

1367
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:50,211
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit.
Tuna tartare?

1368
01:06:50,212 --> 01:06:52,172
And the lobster claws,
that'll get us started.

1369
01:06:52,173 --> 01:06:55,675
Christy, what do you like to drink?

1370
01:06:55,676 --> 01:06:56,968
An appletini.

1371
01:06:56,969 --> 01:06:59,721
Great. Four of those.

1372
01:06:59,722 --> 01:07:04,722
From that point on, it was a Seanathon.

1373
01:07:11,233 --> 01:07:16,233
The question was,
"What did you talk about?"

1374
01:07:25,372 --> 01:07:27,749
He took us through his episode
with Napster.

1375
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:30,877
I didn't wanna spend my 20s
as a professional defendant.

1376
01:07:30,878 --> 01:07:34,047
Who knew? The music industry
doesn't have a sense of humour.

1377
01:07:34,048 --> 01:07:37,383
We tried to sell the company to pay the
<i>35</i> million they said we owed in royalties,

1378
01:07:37,384 --> 01:07:42,384
but I guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.

1379
01:07:42,556 --> 01:07:45,099
So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy.

1380
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,852
- But you made a name for yourself.
- And you are dry.

1381
01:07:47,853 --> 01:07:49,687
- Tori!
- No, no, I'm good.

1382
01:07:49,688 --> 01:07:52,440
And then he went on to
his second business venture,

1383
01:07:52,441 --> 01:07:55,944
which was an online Rolodex that
he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

1384
01:07:55,945 --> 01:07:58,112
And I wanted to do it nice this time.

1385
01:07:58,113 --> 01:08:01,783
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes,
but nobody wants to take orders from a kid.

1386
01:08:01,784 --> 01:08:04,786
So let me tell you what happens to
a 20-year-0ld at the top of a hot dot-com.

1387
01:08:04,787 --> 01:08:08,039
- I'm not a psychiatrist, but...
- I'm glad we've got that on the record.

1388
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,416
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?

1389
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:13,461
A psychiatrist would say
that he was paranoid.

1390
01:08:13,462 --> 01:08:15,964
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.

1391
01:08:15,965 --> 01:08:18,132
You're a target for high-priced escorts.

1392
01:08:18,133 --> 01:08:20,593
I can't prove it,
but I know they tap my phones.

1393
01:08:20,594 --> 01:08:23,263
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up,
you've done already.

1394
01:08:23,264 --> 01:08:25,890
Private behaviour is a relic
of a time gone by.

1395
01:08:25,891 --> 01:08:28,810
And if somehow, someway, you've managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama,

1396
01:08:28,811 --> 01:08:30,103
they'll make shit up.

1397
01:08:30,104 --> 01:08:32,981
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.

1398
01:08:32,982 --> 01:08:34,941
And they want you
to say "thank you" while you...

1399
01:08:34,942 --> 01:08:36,067
Excuse me.

1400
01:08:36,068 --> 01:08:37,610
Wipe your chin and walk away.

1401
01:08:37,611 --> 01:08:38,778
That's what happened to you?

1402
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:40,989
And delusional.

1403
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:44,158
Yes. But there'll be payback at Case.

1404
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,827
I brought down the record companies
with Napster

1405
01:08:45,828 --> 01:08:47,245
and Case'II suffer for their sins, too.

1406
01:08:47,246 --> 01:08:50,164
Sorry, you didn't bring down
the record companies.

1407
01:08:50,165 --> 01:08:51,332
They won.

1408
01:08:51,333 --> 01:08:53,334
- In court.
- Yeah.

1409
01:08:53,335 --> 01:08:58,335
You wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?

1410
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:01,843
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley,

1411
01:09:01,844 --> 01:09:05,972
and parties at Stanford and down in LA,
and friends who'd become millionaires...

1412
01:09:05,973 --> 01:09:10,973
But mostly how Mark had to...
He had to come to California.

1413
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:14,188
And then he got around to The Facebook.

1414
01:09:14,189 --> 01:09:16,774
So, tell me about your progress.

1415
01:09:16,775 --> 01:09:20,528
Well, we're in 29 schools now.
We got over 75,000 members.

1416
01:09:20,529 --> 01:09:22,363
- Tell me about the strategy you're using.
- Okay.

1417
01:09:22,364 --> 01:09:24,365
For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,

1418
01:09:24,366 --> 01:09:26,326
but Baylor already had
a social network on campus.

1419
01:09:26,327 --> 01:09:27,994
So instead of going right after them,

1420
01:09:27,995 --> 01:09:30,163
we made a list of every school
within 100 miles...

1421
01:09:30,164 --> 01:09:31,289
You put The Facebook
on those campuses first.

1422
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:34,208
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw
their friends on our site and we were in.

1423
01:09:34,209 --> 01:09:35,668
It's called the Little Bighorn.
That's smart, Mark.

1424
01:09:35,669 --> 01:09:37,128
- Thanks, that was mine.
- Easy.

1425
01:09:37,129 --> 01:09:39,005
Hey, you know what?
Settle an argument for us.

1426
01:09:39,006 --> 01:09:41,007
I say it's time to start making money
from The Facebook,

1427
01:09:41,008 --> 01:09:42,967
but Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?

1428
01:09:42,968 --> 01:09:44,886
Well...

1429
01:09:44,887 --> 01:09:46,220
Neither of you yet.

1430
01:09:46,221 --> 01:09:48,681
The Facebook is cool,
that's what it's got going for it.

1431
01:09:48,682 --> 01:09:49,807
Yeah.

1432
01:09:49,808 --> 01:09:51,559
You don't wanna ruin it with ads
because ads aren't cool.

1433
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,727
Exactly.

1434
01:09:52,728 --> 01:09:54,312
It's like you're throwing
the greatest party on campus

1435
01:09:54,313 --> 01:09:55,688
and someone's saying
it's gotta be over by 11:00.

1436
01:09:55,689 --> 01:09:56,814
That's exactly right.

1437
01:09:56,815 --> 01:09:59,067
- You don't even know what the thing is yet.
- Exactly.

1438
01:09:59,068 --> 01:10:02,862
How big it can get, how far it can go.
This is no time to take your chips down.

1439
01:10:02,863 --> 01:10:04,864
A million dollars isn't cool.
You know what's cool?

1440
01:10:04,865 --> 01:10:08,701
You?

1441
01:10:08,702 --> 01:10:13,665
"A billion dollars."

1442
01:10:13,666 --> 01:10:15,333
And that shut everybody up.

1443
01:10:15,334 --> 01:10:19,170
And that's where you're headed.
A billion-dollar valuation.

1444
01:10:19,171 --> 01:10:21,923
Unless you take bad advice, in which case
you may as well have come up with

1445
01:10:21,924 --> 01:10:24,300
a chain of very successful yogurt shops.

1446
01:10:24,301 --> 01:10:28,054
When you go fishing, you can catch
a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

1447
01:10:28,055 --> 01:10:31,432
You ever walk into a guy's den and see
a picture of him standing next to 14 trout?

1448
01:10:31,433 --> 01:10:33,351
- No, he's holding a 3,000-pound marlin.
- Yep.

1449
01:10:33,352 --> 01:10:34,519
- That's a good analogy.
- Okay.

1450
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,979
But we all know marlins don't really
weigh 3,000 pounds, right?

1451
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,106
Have you seen the big ones up close?

1452
01:10:38,107 --> 01:10:41,150
No, but I don't think the guy's holding
a marlin the size of a Range Rover.

1453
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,861
That would be a really big fish
and a very strong guy.

1454
01:10:43,862 --> 01:10:45,488
You think we might be getting away
from the point?

1455
01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:49,867
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.

1456
01:10:49,868 --> 01:10:52,620
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1457
01:10:52,621 --> 01:10:55,081
He picked up the cheque,
he told Mark they'd talk again soon,

1458
01:10:55,082 --> 01:10:56,249
and he was gone.

1459
01:10:56,250 --> 01:11:01,250
But not before he made his biggest
contribution to the company.

1460
01:11:02,506 --> 01:11:05,550
Drop the "The." Just "Facebook."

1461
01:11:05,551 --> 01:11:10,012
It's cleaner.

1462
01:11:10,013 --> 01:11:13,766
Shit.

1463
01:11:13,767 --> 01:11:15,852
Goodbye, sweetie.

1464
01:11:15,853 --> 01:11:16,353
Yeah.

1465
01:11:20,941 --> 01:11:23,943
That's gotta be some kind of
land speed record for talking.

1466
01:11:23,944 --> 01:11:27,071
You wanna end the party at 11:00.

1467
01:11:27,072 --> 01:11:31,534
- I'm trying to pay for the party.
- There won't be a party unless it's cool.

1468
01:11:31,535 --> 01:11:32,702
So, what do you think?

1469
01:11:32,703 --> 01:11:34,746
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The."

1470
01:11:34,747 --> 01:11:37,957
I meant to catching the marlin
instead of the 14 trout.

1471
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:39,333
Doesn't that sound good?

1472
01:11:39,334 --> 01:11:41,210
If you're a trout.

1473
01:11:41,211 --> 01:11:42,754
I'm going to enter this into the record.

1474
01:11:42,755 --> 01:11:46,758
Incorporation papers for Facebook,
an LLC registered in Florida.

1475
01:11:46,759 --> 01:11:48,926
- Why Florida?
- It's where my family lives.

1476
01:11:48,927 --> 01:11:51,679
And ask the respondent to stipulate
that the articles of incorporation

1477
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:55,433
state the ownership as follows:
65% for Mark Zuckerberg,

1478
01:11:55,434 --> 01:11:58,644
30% for Eduardo Saverin
and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz.

1479
01:11:58,645 --> 01:11:59,812
Yeah, we stipulate.

1480
01:11:59,813 --> 01:12:02,774
- And that was April 13th, 2004.
- You can mark it.

1481
01:12:02,775 --> 01:12:04,484
You have anything here?

1482
01:12:04,485 --> 01:12:05,860
Yes. Thank you.

1483
01:12:05,861 --> 01:12:08,654
Mr Saverin, have you ever done anything

1484
01:12:08,655 --> 01:12:13,075
that might be considered
legitimate grounds for termination?

1485
01:12:13,076 --> 01:12:14,202
No.

1486
01:12:14,203 --> 01:12:19,203
You never did anything to embarrass the
company or even seriously jeopardise it?

1487
01:12:19,374 --> 01:12:24,337
<i>- No.
- No?</i>

1488
01:12:24,338 --> 01:12:25,463
No.

1489
01:12:25,464 --> 01:12:29,217
You were accused of animal cruelty.

1490
01:12:29,218 --> 01:12:31,761
- Wait.
- You weren't?

1491
01:12:31,762 --> 01:12:34,096
This is not happening.

1492
01:12:34,097 --> 01:12:36,516
<i>I have here an article from The Crimson...</i>

1493
01:12:36,517 --> 01:12:37,683
Jesus Christ.

1494
01:12:37,684 --> 01:12:38,810
I can't have this, Wardo.

1495
01:12:38,811 --> 01:12:43,811
Come on, man. This is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.

1496
01:12:43,816 --> 01:12:46,150
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.

1497
01:12:46,151 --> 01:12:48,861
I'd been accepted,
and as part of my initiation I had to,

1498
01:12:48,862 --> 01:12:52,949
for one week, carry with me at all times
and take care of a chicken.

1499
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:55,660
They identify you
as one of the founders of Facebook.

1500
01:12:55,661 --> 01:12:57,119
"Junior Eduardo Saverin..."

1501
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,163
I'm not the expert, but being connected
to torturing animals

1502
01:12:59,164 --> 01:13:00,581
is probably bad for business.

1503
01:13:00,582 --> 01:13:05,503
I did not torture the chicken.
I don't torture chickens. Are you crazy?

1504
01:13:05,504 --> 01:13:09,423
No, and settle down, please.
I have here an article from The Crimson...

1505
01:13:09,424 --> 01:13:11,384
- This is scathing.
- 956.

1506
01:13:11,385 --> 01:13:14,554
I was having dinner in
the Kirkland dining hall with Mark,

1507
01:13:14,555 --> 01:13:16,013
and I had the chicken with me,

1508
01:13:16,014 --> 01:13:18,099
because I had to have the chicken
with me at all times.

1509
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,267
This was college.

1510
01:13:19,268 --> 01:13:21,811
- Somebody's gonna have to answer for this.
- 969.

1511
01:13:21,812 --> 01:13:24,063
And the dining hall
was serving chicken for dinner,

1512
01:13:24,064 --> 01:13:26,566
and I had to feed my chicken, so I...

1513
01:13:26,567 --> 01:13:30,361
Well, I took little pieces of chicken
and I gave it to the chicken.

1514
01:13:30,362 --> 01:13:32,113
Someone must have seen me,
because the next thing I knew

1515
01:13:32,114 --> 01:13:34,782
I was being accused of forced cannibalism.

1516
01:13:34,783 --> 01:13:37,702
I didn't know you couldn't do that.

1517
01:13:37,703 --> 01:13:39,787
I dealt with the various
animal rights groups,

1518
01:13:39,788 --> 01:13:42,290
I dealt with the associate dean
of the college.

1519
01:13:42,291 --> 01:13:44,041
This was all resolved.

1520
01:13:44,042 --> 01:13:45,167
988.

1521
01:13:45,168 --> 01:13:47,295
Someone from the Porc or the Fly
must have reported it.

1522
01:13:47,296 --> 01:13:49,213
For all I know, it was the Winklevosses.

1523
01:13:49,214 --> 01:13:51,007
All right, let's just forget about it.

1524
01:13:51,008 --> 01:13:54,051
This is absurd.
I'm being accused of animal cruelty.

1525
01:13:54,052 --> 01:13:55,595
It's better to be accused of necrophilia.

1526
01:13:55,596 --> 01:13:57,305
It is better to be accused of necrophilia.

1527
01:13:57,306 --> 01:14:00,766
Now I have to explain this to my father. I'm
gonna have to explain this to everybody.

1528
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:02,268
What is happening on that?

1529
01:14:02,269 --> 01:14:04,437
I have my final coming up
for Postwar and Contemporary Art

1530
01:14:04,438 --> 01:14:05,771
and I haven't been to class.

1531
01:14:05,772 --> 01:14:07,398
I'm supposed to write about
these four paintings.

1532
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:08,816
That's a Facebook page?

1533
01:14:08,817 --> 01:14:09,942
Yeah. I opened it under an alias.

1534
01:14:09,943 --> 01:14:11,444
I posted the paintings
and asked people to comment.

1535
01:14:11,445 --> 01:14:14,530
Every once in a while, I hop on and stir
the pot to get a good debate going.

1536
01:14:14,531 --> 01:14:17,033
Mr Zuckerberg was cheating
on his final exam?

1537
01:14:17,034 --> 01:14:19,911
- I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.
- And why not?

1538
01:14:19,912 --> 01:14:22,747
Because I'm not suing him
for cheating on his final exam.

1539
01:14:22,748 --> 01:14:26,834
- That's not what friends do.
- Well, you just told us he was cheating.

1540
01:14:26,835 --> 01:14:30,212
Oops.

1541
01:14:30,213 --> 01:14:32,256
You told your lawyers
I was torturing animals?

1542
01:14:32,257 --> 01:14:33,966
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

1543
01:14:33,967 --> 01:14:36,802
Our litigators are capable
of finding a <i>Crimson</i> article.

1544
01:14:36,803 --> 01:14:41,803
In fact, when we raised the subject
with him, he defended you.

1545
01:14:41,975 --> 01:14:43,434
Oops.

1546
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:46,103
993. We are so close.

1547
01:14:46,104 --> 01:14:49,357
Yeah, that reminds me,
we're gonna need more money, Wardo.

1548
01:14:49,358 --> 01:14:51,484
Yeah, no, I agree. More servers, more help.

1549
01:14:51,485 --> 01:14:53,319
I'm interviewing two interns
to come to Palo Alto

1550
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,487
and we're gonna have
to pay them something.

1551
01:14:54,488 --> 01:14:56,530
- Sorry, what?
- I already found a house for rent

1552
01:14:56,531 --> 01:14:58,366
on a street
two blocks from the Stanford campus.

1553
01:14:58,367 --> 01:14:59,784
It is perfect and it's got a pool.

1554
01:14:59,785 --> 01:15:01,869
When did you decide to go to California
for the summer?

1555
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:03,204
You mean when did I actually decide?

1556
01:15:03,205 --> 01:15:06,791
Was it somewhere in the middle
of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1557
01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:09,085
He was right,
California's the place we've gotta be.

1558
01:15:09,086 --> 01:15:10,586
What, you're Jed Clampett?

1559
01:15:10,587 --> 01:15:12,713
<i>I didn't know you</i> guys
<i>got The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil.</i>

1560
01:15:12,714 --> 01:15:14,840
Yeah, got the show in
Brazil, it was genius.

1561
01:15:14,841 --> 01:15:17,885
- What is your problem with Sean?
- He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1562
01:15:17,886 --> 01:15:20,012
He doesn't have money.
Dustin's a better programmer.

1563
01:15:20,013 --> 01:15:23,683
- He's got connections to VCs.
- We don't need VCs, we need advertisers.

1564
01:15:23,684 --> 01:15:25,685
- And I have connections to VCs.
- No real players.

1565
01:15:25,686 --> 01:15:28,354
And as somebody who's just really
embarrassed the company in a bad way...

1566
01:15:28,355 --> 01:15:30,648
- It was the Winklevosses, Mark.
- Hang on.

1567
01:15:30,649 --> 01:15:32,817
Hit "Refresh."

1568
01:15:32,818 --> 01:15:36,028
150,004.

1569
01:15:36,029 --> 01:15:38,781
150,000 members, Wardo.

1570
01:15:38,782 --> 01:15:40,825
- Congratulations, dude.
- Congratulations.

1571
01:15:40,826 --> 01:15:44,745
You don't think it was strange that
he was followed by private detectives?

1572
01:15:44,746 --> 01:15:46,497
Who came up with nothing.

1573
01:15:46,498 --> 01:15:48,541
Enough to get him out of the company.
The drugs, the girls.

1574
01:15:48,542 --> 01:15:50,751
- We don't know that any of that's true.
- You can read about it.

1575
01:15:50,752 --> 01:15:52,378
I can read about you torturing birds.
Since when...

1576
01:15:52,379 --> 01:15:57,379
Okay, don't fish eat other fish?
The marlins and the trout?

1577
01:15:58,552 --> 01:15:59,677
What's he talking about?

1578
01:15:59,678 --> 01:16:02,430
I'm interviewing interns at 10:00
tomorrow night in the CS lab.

1579
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,681
Get on board with this, man.

1580
01:16:03,682 --> 01:16:08,682
You know, I don't really know
what else to say.

1581
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:34,583
You can do one more! One more!

1582
01:16:36,673 --> 01:16:37,798
Wardo!

1583
01:16:37,799 --> 01:16:41,010
Yo! Mark!

1584
01:16:41,011 --> 01:16:42,136
What's going on?

1585
01:16:42,137 --> 01:16:44,597
They have 10 minutes to get root access
to a Python web server,

1586
01:16:44,598 --> 01:16:45,973
expose its SSL encryption,

1587
01:16:45,974 --> 01:16:47,725
and then intercept all traffic
over its secure port.

1588
01:16:47,726 --> 01:16:48,893
They're hacking.

1589
01:16:48,894 --> 01:16:50,978
Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator.
But here's the beauty.

1590
01:16:50,979 --> 01:16:52,897
You know I didn't understand
anything you just said, right?

1591
01:16:52,898 --> 01:16:54,106
- I do know that.
- So what's the beauty?

1592
01:16:54,107 --> 01:16:56,108
Every tenth line of code written,
they have to drink a shot.

1593
01:16:56,109 --> 01:16:59,195
Hacking's supposed to be stealth, so every
time the server detects an intrusion,

1594
01:16:59,196 --> 01:17:01,113
the candidate responsible
has to drink a shot.

1595
01:17:01,114 --> 01:17:02,907
I also have a program running
that has a pop-up window

1596
01:17:02,908 --> 01:17:04,825
appear simultaneously
on all five computers.

1597
01:17:04,826 --> 01:17:06,911
The last candidate to hit the window
has to drink a shot.

1598
01:17:06,912 --> 01:17:09,121
Plus, every three minutes
they all have to drink a shot.

1599
01:17:09,122 --> 01:17:11,665
- Three minutes!
- Drink one now!

1600
01:17:11,666 --> 01:17:15,377
Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's
job will they need to be able to do drunk?

1601
01:17:15,378 --> 01:17:16,504
You're right.

1602
01:17:16,505 --> 01:17:21,505
A more relevant test might be seeing if
they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1603
01:17:21,593 --> 01:17:23,677
- That was mean.
- Here.

1604
01:17:23,678 --> 01:17:24,804
What is this?

1605
01:17:24,805 --> 01:17:29,350
I opened a new account
and put $18,000 in it.

1606
01:17:29,351 --> 01:17:31,310
Will that get you through the summer?

1607
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:32,436
- Here!
- Mark?

1608
01:17:32,437 --> 01:17:37,437
Right here!

1609
01:17:39,027 --> 01:17:44,027
Welcome to Facebook.

1610
01:17:50,247 --> 01:17:52,039
- $18,000?
- Yes.

1611
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,458
In addition to the $1,000
you'd already put up.

1612
01:17:54,459 --> 01:17:57,128
- Yes.
- A total of $19,000 now.

1613
01:17:57,129 --> 01:18:00,548
- Yes.
- Hang on.

1614
01:18:00,549 --> 01:18:02,091
I'm just checking your math on that.

1615
01:18:02,092 --> 01:18:05,010
Yes, I got the same thing.

1616
01:18:05,011 --> 01:18:06,679
May I continue?

1617
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,682
After expressing misgivings
about Mr Zuckerberg taking the company

1618
01:18:09,683 --> 01:18:11,809
and moving it to California for the summer,

1619
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:14,895
why did you put $18,000
in an account for his use?

1620
01:18:14,896 --> 01:18:18,732
I figured we were partners.
I wanted to be a team player.

1621
01:18:18,733 --> 01:18:21,902
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns
could work on the site

1622
01:18:21,903 --> 01:18:24,446
while I was generating
advertiser interest in New York.

1623
01:18:24,447 --> 01:18:29,447
But mostly I figured, how much could
possibly go wrong in three months?

1624
01:18:30,787 --> 01:18:35,787
GO, go; Go: Go!

1625
01:18:37,169 --> 01:18:38,878
- I didn't die.
- I know.

1626
01:18:38,879 --> 01:18:42,131
- I made it.
- You did.

1627
01:18:42,132 --> 01:18:43,549
Okay, ready?

1628
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:45,885
- That was like an 8.
- That was like a 2.

1629
01:18:45,886 --> 01:18:50,886
- It was better than that.
- Yeah.

1630
01:18:56,938 --> 01:18:58,063
I'm okay.

1631
01:18:58,064 --> 01:18:59,940
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1632
01:18:59,941 --> 01:19:02,401
Yikes.

1633
01:19:02,402 --> 01:19:03,861
That's the doorbell.

1634
01:19:03,862 --> 01:19:05,154
I didn't know we had a doorbell.

1635
01:19:05,155 --> 01:19:07,948
- Andrew, get the door!
- No, he's wired in.

1636
01:19:07,949 --> 01:19:12,036
That's gonna cut into
your security deposit.

1637
01:19:12,037 --> 01:19:13,204
- Andrew.
- Not now.

1638
01:19:13,205 --> 01:19:13,817
Good boy.

1639
01:19:18,668 --> 01:19:20,085
- Sean?
- Mark?

1640
01:19:20,086 --> 01:19:22,338
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

1641
01:19:22,339 --> 01:19:23,464
Do you?

1642
01:19:23,465 --> 01:19:25,090
We were right across the street.
We saw the chimney...

1643
01:19:25,091 --> 01:19:29,094
- Is anybody hurt?
- No. You live across the street?

1644
01:19:29,095 --> 01:19:30,346
I'm Sharon.

1645
01:19:30,347 --> 01:19:32,806
This is my... Sharon.
She lives across the street.

1646
01:19:32,807 --> 01:19:34,183
I was helping her move out,
we saw the chimney...

1647
01:19:34,184 --> 01:19:37,019
We had a zip line to the pool.

1648
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:39,980
You came to California.

1649
01:19:39,981 --> 01:19:41,065
Yeah.

1650
01:19:41,066 --> 01:19:46,066
You made the right choice.

1651
01:19:49,157 --> 01:19:54,157
Here you go.

1652
01:19:54,829 --> 01:19:58,332
Sharon?

1653
01:19:58,333 --> 01:19:59,416
I'm so sorry.

1654
01:19:59,417 --> 01:20:00,542
- No problem.
- I didn't know you were gonna...

1655
01:20:00,543 --> 01:20:04,004
- Here you go.
- No, no, no. Wait!

1656
01:20:04,005 --> 01:20:08,842
This house and this team are great.
It's exactly what it should be.

1657
01:20:08,843 --> 01:20:10,261
I'm Sean Parker.

1658
01:20:10,262 --> 01:20:11,929
Oh, he's wired in.

1659
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:15,182
That's what I'm talking about.

1660
01:20:15,183 --> 01:20:16,392
Where's Eduardo?

1661
01:20:16,393 --> 01:20:19,561
He got an internship in New York.

1662
01:20:19,562 --> 01:20:24,562
Eduardo didn't come out?

1663
01:20:41,543 --> 01:20:44,378
I was crashing there for a little bit
while I'm taking care of some things,

1664
01:20:44,379 --> 01:20:47,881
but she's done for the summer
so she's back at her parents' place.

1665
01:20:47,882 --> 01:20:51,427
- The homeless rock star of Palo Alto.
- All right.

1666
01:20:51,428 --> 01:20:55,055
What's your plan for the summer?

1667
01:20:55,056 --> 01:20:56,890
Mark?

1668
01:20:56,891 --> 01:21:00,394
I'm sorry. I was looking
at the architecture.

1669
01:21:00,395 --> 01:21:01,812
I asked what your plan for the...

1670
01:21:01,813 --> 01:21:03,397
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer.

1671
01:21:03,398 --> 01:21:05,274
- We're gonna go to the restroom.
- Okay.

1672
01:21:05,275 --> 01:21:10,275
Yeah, I'll go with you.

1673
01:21:10,905 --> 01:21:12,489
Your date looks so familiar to me.

1674
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:14,158
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

1675
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:17,411
What do you mean?

1676
01:21:17,412 --> 01:21:20,914
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie,

1677
01:21:20,915 --> 01:21:23,792
but he's too embarrassed
to shop for it in a department store.

1678
01:21:23,793 --> 01:21:25,753
He comes up with an idea
for a high-end place

1679
01:21:25,754 --> 01:21:28,130
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

1680
01:21:28,131 --> 01:21:32,259
He gets a $40,000 bank loan,
borrows another 40,000 from his in-laws,

1681
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:35,304
opens a store and calls
it Victoria's Secret.

1682
01:21:35,305 --> 01:21:38,098
Makes a half million
dollars his first year.

1683
01:21:38,099 --> 01:21:42,019
Starts a catalogue, opens three more stores,
and after five years, he sells the company

1684
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:45,439
to Leslie Wexner and The Limited
for $4 million.

1685
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,149
Happy ending, right?

1686
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:51,487
Except two years later,
the company's worth $500 million,

1687
01:21:51,488 --> 01:21:56,488
and Roy Raymond jumps off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

1688
01:21:56,993 --> 01:22:01,955
Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife
a pair of thigh-highs, you know?

1689
01:22:01,956 --> 01:22:04,166
Was that a parable?

1690
01:22:04,167 --> 01:22:08,462
My date's a Victoria's Secret model.
That's why she looks familiar to you.

1691
01:22:08,463 --> 01:22:10,005
- God.
- Don't be impressed by all this.

1692
01:22:10,006 --> 01:22:11,340
I read your blog.

1693
01:22:11,341 --> 01:22:13,467
You know, no, that was for web cretins.

1694
01:22:13,468 --> 01:22:16,303
You know why I started Napster?

1695
01:22:16,304 --> 01:22:21,183
The girl I loved in high school was with the
co-captain of the varsity lacrosse team,

1696
01:22:21,184 --> 01:22:23,310
and I wanted to take her from him.

1697
01:22:23,311 --> 01:22:25,646
So I decided to come up with
the next big thing.

1698
01:22:25,647 --> 01:22:28,315
- I didn't know that.
- Napster wasn't a failure.

1699
01:22:28,316 --> 01:22:31,819
I changed the music industry
for better and for always.

1700
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:36,156
It may not have been good business,
but it pissed a lot of people off.

1701
01:22:36,157 --> 01:22:38,700
And isn't that what your Facemash
was about?

1702
01:22:38,701 --> 01:22:41,495
They're scared of me, pal,
and they're gonna be scared of you.

1703
01:22:41,496 --> 01:22:43,330
What the VCs want is to say,

1704
01:22:43,331 --> 01:22:46,250
"Good idea, kid,
the grown-ups will take it from here."

1705
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:49,336
But not this time. This is our time.

1706
01:22:49,337 --> 01:22:52,881
This time, you're gonna hand them
a business card that says,

1707
01:22:52,882 --> 01:22:55,843
"I'm CEO, bitch."

1708
01:22:55,844 --> 01:22:58,387
That's what I want for you.

1709
01:22:58,388 --> 01:23:01,181
So where the hell is Eduardo?

1710
01:23:01,182 --> 01:23:03,725
- He's in New York.
- Sucking up to ad execs.

1711
01:23:03,726 --> 01:23:06,854
- He's got an...
- An internship.

1712
01:23:06,855 --> 01:23:11,775
The company's here.
A billion-dollar company's here.

1713
01:23:11,776 --> 01:23:13,402
- Do you live and breathe Facebook?
- Yes.

1714
01:23:13,403 --> 01:23:14,611
I know you do.

1715
01:23:14,612 --> 01:23:17,781
Wardo wants to be a businessman and for
all I know he's gonna be a good one,

1716
01:23:17,782 --> 01:23:22,536
but he shouldn't be in New York
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.

1717
01:23:22,537 --> 01:23:26,039
This is a once-in-a-generation,
"holy shit" idea.

1718
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:31,040
And the water under
the Golden Gate is freezing cold.

1719
01:23:31,421 --> 01:23:36,421
Look at my face and tell me
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1720
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:38,886
Do you ever think about that girl?

1721
01:23:38,887 --> 01:23:40,053
What girl?

1722
01:23:40,054 --> 01:23:44,725
The girl from high school
with the lacrosse thing.

1723
01:23:44,726 --> 01:23:45,809
No.

1724
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:49,438
If you guys are gonna talk about bandwidth,
we need shots.

1725
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:51,064
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer?

1726
01:23:51,065 --> 01:23:52,149
Yeah.

1727
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:53,609
Tell you what. Gesture of good faith.

1728
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:58,610
While you're getting into 100 schools,
I'll put you on two continents.

1729
01:23:59,240 --> 01:23:59,740
Two...

1730
01:24:04,787 --> 01:24:06,330
If you don't have a place to crash,

1731
01:24:06,331 --> 01:24:09,583
I think you should definitely
come and live with us.

1732
01:24:09,584 --> 01:24:11,585
Let's line up some shots.

1733
01:24:11,586 --> 01:24:13,795
- Excuse me!
- Yes, sir.

1734
01:24:13,796 --> 01:24:17,007
You can take this away
and bring back the 1942.

1735
01:24:17,008 --> 01:24:22,008
Absolutely, Mr Parker.

1736
01:24:35,109 --> 01:24:40,109
Attention... Go!

1737
01:24:54,963 --> 01:24:59,963
<i>At the barrier, Hollandia is
leading Harvard University by one length.</i>

1738
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:10,561
<i>Approaching the grandstands,</i>

1739
01:25:10,562 --> 01:25:15,562
<i>Holland/a maintains a lead
of three-quarters of a length.</i>

1740
01:25:26,911 --> 01:25:27,455
Come on!

1741
01:26:06,826 --> 01:26:07,438
Whatever.

1742
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:15,000
- Mr Winklevoss.
- Tyler.

1743
01:26:15,001 --> 01:26:16,918
- Tremendous race.
- Thank you.

1744
01:26:16,919 --> 01:26:19,254
- And this is my brother, Cameron.
- Excellent.

1745
01:26:19,255 --> 01:26:20,380
Sir?

1746
01:26:20,381 --> 01:26:22,215
His Royal Highness Prince Albert.

1747
01:26:22,216 --> 01:26:24,051
Your Highness, this is
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

1748
01:26:24,052 --> 01:26:27,512
Of course. Brilliant race.
I've never seen a race that close.

1749
01:26:27,513 --> 01:26:28,597
Yes, Your Highness.

1750
01:26:28,598 --> 01:26:31,725
My grandfather, Jack Kelly,
was one of the premier rowers of his day.

1751
01:26:31,726 --> 01:26:35,562
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years
and I'd never seen a race that close.

1752
01:26:35,563 --> 01:26:37,272
Have you? Have you seen a race that close?

1753
01:26:37,273 --> 01:26:38,440
No, Your Highness.

1754
01:26:38,441 --> 01:26:40,901
Mile-and-a-half races are more
commonly won by a boat length or two.

1755
01:26:40,902 --> 01:26:43,904
Yes, that's absolutely right.
Brutally close.

1756
01:26:43,905 --> 01:26:45,072
May I introduce my teammates?

1757
01:26:45,073 --> 01:26:47,074
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse us.

1758
01:26:47,075 --> 01:26:52,075
On to the Dutch.

1759
01:26:52,246 --> 01:26:53,747
Sorry you flew all the way out here
to see that.

1760
01:26:53,748 --> 01:26:55,957
Wouldn't have missed it, brother.
How was the royalty?

1761
01:26:55,958 --> 01:26:58,710
I just wanted him to tell me
a couple more times how close the race was.

1762
01:26:58,711 --> 01:27:02,297
Just brutal, brutally close.
Brutally excruciating. Jesus.

1763
01:27:02,298 --> 01:27:04,091
The guy is the prince of a country
the size of Nantucket.

1764
01:27:04,092 --> 01:27:05,217
Relax, it's fine.

1765
01:27:05,218 --> 01:27:06,468
- Boys. Divya.
- Dad.

1766
01:27:06,469 --> 01:27:08,595
- Mr Winklevoss.
- That was a tough beat.

1767
01:27:08,596 --> 01:27:10,764
I'm sorry that you and Mom
had to fly out here to see that.

1768
01:27:10,765 --> 01:27:12,974
No, don't ever apologise to me
for losing a race like that.

1769
01:27:12,975 --> 01:27:15,727
Don't ever apologise to anyone
for losing a race like that.

1770
01:27:15,728 --> 01:27:18,230
- Boys.
- Mr Kenwright.

1771
01:27:18,231 --> 01:27:20,982
Dad, this is Mr Kenwright,
head of the host family for this week.

1772
01:27:20,983 --> 01:27:22,818
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

1773
01:27:22,819 --> 01:27:24,319
I've just had a phone
chat with my daughter.

1774
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,406
She told me that she and her friends
are already talking about the race,

1775
01:27:27,407 --> 01:27:29,783
which they've just seen
via their computers.

1776
01:27:29,784 --> 01:27:34,784
A new website called Facebook.
Do you have this in America?

1777
01:27:34,956 --> 01:27:38,667
I'm gonna find your mother.

1778
01:27:38,668 --> 01:27:39,793
Have I said something wrong?

1779
01:27:39,794 --> 01:27:41,795
Your daughter doesn't go
to school in the States?

1780
01:27:41,796 --> 01:27:43,171
No, no. Cambridge.

1781
01:27:43,172 --> 01:27:46,007
Majoring in French literature, though
I wasn't aware there was such a thing.

1782
01:27:46,008 --> 01:27:47,175
And they have Facebook at Cambridge?

1783
01:27:47,176 --> 01:27:49,344
And apparently Oxford and
the London School of Economics.

1784
01:27:49,345 --> 01:27:51,012
That's where her friends are.

1785
01:27:51,013 --> 01:27:52,973
That's awesome.

1786
01:27:52,974 --> 01:27:57,974
Good race, boys.
Take the bitter with the better, eh?

1787
01:27:58,813 --> 01:28:03,525
I'm gonna go watch the race film.

1788
01:28:03,526 --> 01:28:05,944
If this is online, I wanna see it.

1789
01:28:05,945 --> 01:28:07,821
Stop it.

1790
01:28:07,822 --> 01:28:09,698
Stop it, Cam.

1791
01:28:09,699 --> 01:28:11,783
Knock it off.

1792
01:28:11,784 --> 01:28:14,453
I don't mind that we lost
to the Dutch today by less than a second.

1793
01:28:14,454 --> 01:28:16,705
That was a good race,
and that was a fair race.

1794
01:28:16,706 --> 01:28:18,290
And they'll see us again.

1795
01:28:18,291 --> 01:28:20,500
What I mind, and what you should mind,

1796
01:28:20,501 --> 01:28:24,212
is showing up on Monday
for a race that was run on Sunday.

1797
01:28:24,213 --> 01:28:26,214
We tried talking to him ourselves,
we tried writing a letter,

1798
01:28:26,215 --> 01:28:29,885
we tried the Ad Board, and we tried
talking to the president of the university.

1799
01:28:29,886 --> 01:28:32,512
Now, I am asking you for the last time,

1800
01:28:32,513 --> 01:28:37,513
let's take the considerable resources at
our disposal and sue him in federal court.

1801
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:40,812
Come on.

1802
01:28:40,813 --> 01:28:45,813
I need a real drink.

1803
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:51,990
Screw it.

1804
01:28:51,991 --> 01:28:56,991
Let's gut the friggin' nerd.

1805
01:28:57,038 --> 01:28:58,538
That's what I'm talking about!

1806
01:28:58,539 --> 01:29:00,540
No, no, no, no, no.

1807
01:29:00,541 --> 01:29:02,876
But check it out, I saw him today.

1808
01:29:02,877 --> 01:29:05,378
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham,
my Case Equity guy.

1809
01:29:05,379 --> 01:29:06,546
Hang on.

1810
01:29:06,547 --> 01:29:08,298
Are you guys using Spikes
or Ghost Missiles?

1811
01:29:08,299 --> 01:29:10,050
We don't know,
we're just shooting at each other.

1812
01:29:10,051 --> 01:29:11,551
Use Sweet Kamikazes.

1813
01:29:11,552 --> 01:29:14,179
Like we know what that is.

1814
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:18,058
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera
and he saw me, too.

1815
01:29:18,059 --> 01:29:22,062
I know he did.

1816
01:29:22,063 --> 01:29:25,190
Don't. Don't sweat it. I'm on a landline.

1817
01:29:25,191 --> 01:29:27,234
Bong hit.

1818
01:29:27,235 --> 01:29:28,819
Does anybody hear that banging?

1819
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:31,321
You don't hear anything.
You're writing code.

1820
01:29:31,322 --> 01:29:33,406
Dude, somebody's at the door.

1821
01:29:33,407 --> 01:29:38,407
It's not a dish best served cold. It's
best served immediately and relentlessly.

1822
01:29:41,707 --> 01:29:45,544
I'm gonna call you back.

1823
01:29:45,545 --> 01:29:46,670
What's up?

1824
01:29:46,671 --> 01:29:49,756
What's up?

1825
01:29:49,757 --> 01:29:51,591
Mark was supposed to pick me up
at the airport an hour ago.

1826
01:29:51,592 --> 01:29:53,260
I've been calling his cell.

1827
01:29:53,261 --> 01:29:58,261
He was on a 36-hour coding tear,
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

1828
01:30:04,021 --> 01:30:05,230
What happened here?

1829
01:30:05,231 --> 01:30:08,775
Not happened. Happening.
The next big thing.

1830
01:30:08,776 --> 01:30:10,026
Wardo.

1831
01:30:10,027 --> 01:30:11,111
Hey, man.

1832
01:30:11,112 --> 01:30:13,196
- Back to work.
- Okay.

1833
01:30:13,197 --> 01:30:16,241
The more bad I get at this,
the more wasted I get.

1834
01:30:16,242 --> 01:30:18,118
I mean the more wasted that I get...

1835
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:21,913
We understand.

1836
01:30:21,914 --> 01:30:23,623
How old are they, Sean?

1837
01:30:23,624 --> 01:30:25,041
It's not polite to ask.

1838
01:30:25,042 --> 01:30:27,460
Sean, how old are they?

1839
01:30:27,461 --> 01:30:28,920
You think you know me, right?

1840
01:30:28,921 --> 01:30:30,255
I've read enough.

1841
01:30:30,256 --> 01:30:33,133
You know how much I've read about you?

1842
01:30:33,134 --> 01:30:33,678
Nothing.

1843
01:30:38,306 --> 01:30:40,140
- Wardo.
- Hey, man.

1844
01:30:40,141 --> 01:30:43,143
- I waited an hour for you at the airport.
- What time is it?

1845
01:30:43,144 --> 01:30:46,563
It's midnight. Or 3:00 a.m. in New York,
where I just came from.

1846
01:30:46,564 --> 01:30:50,317
You gotta see some of the new stuff we got.
Hey, Dustin. Show him the Wall.

1847
01:30:50,318 --> 01:30:51,484
I'm just calling it the Wall.

1848
01:30:51,485 --> 01:30:54,154
Forget the Wall, tell him about
the meeting I've got set up.

1849
01:30:54,155 --> 01:30:55,822
You know Peter Thiel?

1850
01:30:55,823 --> 01:30:57,240
- Nope.
- No reason you should.

1851
01:30:57,241 --> 01:31:01,995
He just runs a $2-billion hedge fund
called Clarium Capital.

1852
01:31:01,996 --> 01:31:03,663
Why's he setting up meetings?

1853
01:31:03,664 --> 01:31:04,831
Thiel might wanna make
an angel investment.

1854
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:08,001
I don't care if he's an actual angel.
Why is he setting up business meetings?

1855
01:31:08,002 --> 01:31:10,754
- You've had a long flight.
- No, I had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK,

1856
01:31:10,755 --> 01:31:13,131
then a long wait at the passenger
loading and unloading zone at SFO,

1857
01:31:13,132 --> 01:31:15,133
and in between there was a long flight.

1858
01:31:15,134 --> 01:31:17,594
I'm the business end of this company.

1859
01:31:17,595 --> 01:31:20,138
And he is a houseguest
living here rent free

1860
01:31:20,139 --> 01:31:23,141
on a very generous grant
from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

1861
01:31:23,142 --> 01:31:26,519
I heard about your big-ticket ad buys.
Gary's Tuxedos.

1862
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:28,271
- Hey, man...
- Harvard Bartending Course.

1863
01:31:28,272 --> 01:31:33,272
You're just a small step away from
bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.

1864
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:45,660
- You wanna talk to me alone for a minute?
- Sure.

1865
01:31:47,291 --> 01:31:48,708
Bong hit.

1866
01:31:48,709 --> 01:31:51,544
- I'm so high.
- No, you're not.

1867
01:31:51,545 --> 01:31:53,630
So how's it going?

1868
01:31:53,631 --> 01:31:57,300
How's the internship? How's Christy?

1869
01:31:57,301 --> 01:32:01,179
- How's the internship?
- Yeah.

1870
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:03,223
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.

1871
01:32:03,224 --> 01:32:07,352
We talked about this on the phone.
I quit on my first day.

1872
01:32:07,353 --> 01:32:09,896
I do remember you saying that.

1873
01:32:09,897 --> 01:32:12,065
So how is Christy?

1874
01:32:12,066 --> 01:32:14,025
Christy's crazy.

1875
01:32:14,026 --> 01:32:15,819
- Is that fun?
- No.

1876
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:16,903
I mean, she's actually psychotic.

1877
01:32:16,904 --> 01:32:21,904
She's insanelyjealous, she's irrational,
and I'm frightened of her.

1878
01:32:22,743 --> 01:32:27,580
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.

1879
01:32:27,581 --> 01:32:31,751
I do not want that guy representing
himself as part of this company.

1880
01:32:31,752 --> 01:32:34,004
You gotta move out here, Wardo,
this is where it's all happening.

1881
01:32:34,005 --> 01:32:36,089
- Did you hear what I just said?
- The connections, the energy...

1882
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:37,215
Mark, you got...

1883
01:32:37,216 --> 01:32:39,843
I'm afraid if you don't come out here,
you're gonna get left behind.

1884
01:32:39,844 --> 01:32:42,262
I want... I need you out here.

1885
01:32:42,263 --> 01:32:44,264
- Please don't tell him I said that.
- What did you just say?

1886
01:32:44,265 --> 01:32:46,433
It's moving faster than any of us
ever imagined it would.

1887
01:32:46,434 --> 01:32:48,268
- It's moving fast.
- What did you mean?

1888
01:32:48,269 --> 01:32:50,270
- And Sean thinks we have...
- Sean is not part of this company.

1889
01:32:50,271 --> 01:32:51,438
We have over 300,000 members, Wardo,

1890
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:53,690
and we're in 160 schools,
including five in Europe.

1891
01:32:53,691 --> 01:32:55,275
I'm aware of that! Mark, I am the CFO!

1892
01:32:55,276 --> 01:32:56,776
We need more servers
than I ever expected we'd need.

1893
01:32:56,777 --> 01:32:58,445
We need more programmers
and we need more money,

1894
01:32:58,446 --> 01:33:01,072
and he set up the Thiel meeting.
He set up meetings all over town.

1895
01:33:01,073 --> 01:33:02,365
- He set up other meetings?
- Yes.

1896
01:33:02,366 --> 01:33:04,242
- Without me knowing anything about it.
- You're in New York.

1897
01:33:04,243 --> 01:33:08,246
I'm in New York riding subways
14 hours a day, trying to find advertisers!

1898
01:33:08,247 --> 01:33:13,247
And how's it going so far?

1899
01:33:14,378 --> 01:33:19,378
What did you mean, "get left behind"?

1900
01:33:21,594 --> 01:33:23,053
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

1901
01:33:23,054 --> 01:33:24,637
I'd like to freeze this bank account

1902
01:33:24,638 --> 01:33:29,434
and cancel all existing cheques
and lines of credit.

1903
01:33:29,435 --> 01:33:34,435
- May I see some ID, please?
- Yeah, sure, sorry.

1904
01:33:39,403 --> 01:33:40,737
Sean, he'll be right with you.

1905
01:33:40,738 --> 01:33:43,990
No problem.

1906
01:33:43,991 --> 01:33:46,326
You know this is where
they filmed Towering Inferno?

1907
01:33:46,327 --> 01:33:49,496
That's comforting.

1908
01:33:49,497 --> 01:33:52,749
Hey, guys. Come on back.

1909
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:56,586
- She offer you some waters?
- Oh, yeah. We're cool.

1910
01:33:56,587 --> 01:33:57,921
Sean, how are you? Come on in.

1911
01:33:57,922 --> 01:34:01,633
- You must be Mark.
- Hi.

1912
01:34:01,634 --> 01:34:05,095
We took a look at everything,
and congratulations.

1913
01:34:05,096 --> 01:34:09,015
We're gonna start you off
with a $500,000 investment.

1914
01:34:09,016 --> 01:34:12,811
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.

1915
01:34:12,812 --> 01:34:14,938
We'll file as a Corporation in Delaware

1916
01:34:14,939 --> 01:34:17,941
and come up with a stock structure
that allows for new investors.

1917
01:34:17,942 --> 01:34:20,443
Now, let me ask you something.

1918
01:34:20,444 --> 01:34:25,444
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

1919
01:34:42,716 --> 01:34:47,554
Jesus Christ.

1920
01:34:47,555 --> 01:34:48,721
When did you get back?

1921
01:34:48,722 --> 01:34:50,223
You scared me. I need you to knock.

1922
01:34:50,224 --> 01:34:53,226
When did you get back?

1923
01:34:53,227 --> 01:34:55,019
I got back this afternoon.

1924
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:56,563
And when were you gonna call me?

1925
01:34:56,564 --> 01:34:59,315
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip
and I was tired...

1926
01:34:59,316 --> 01:35:03,319
Yeah, or answer one of my 47 texts.
Did you know I sent 47 texts?

1927
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:07,323
I did, and I thought that was
incredibly normal behaviour.

1928
01:35:07,324 --> 01:35:09,033
Are you mocking me?

1929
01:35:09,034 --> 01:35:12,078
I brought you a present.

1930
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:15,039
Why does your Status say "single"
on your Facebook page?

1931
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,166
What?

1932
01:35:16,167 --> 01:35:20,170
Why does your Relationship Status
say "single" on your Facebook page?

1933
01:35:20,171 --> 01:35:21,921
Well, I was single when I set up the page.

1934
01:35:21,922 --> 01:35:24,090
And you just never bothered to change it?

1935
01:35:24,091 --> 01:35:25,383
What?

1936
01:35:25,384 --> 01:35:26,926
I don't know how.

1937
01:35:26,927 --> 01:35:28,887
Do I look stupid to you?

1938
01:35:28,888 --> 01:35:30,263
No, calm down.

1939
01:35:30,264 --> 01:35:32,599
You're asking me to believe
that the CFO of Facebook

1940
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,934
doesn't know how to change
his Relationship Status on Facebook?

1941
01:35:34,935 --> 01:35:38,396
It's embarrassing, so you should take it as
a sign of trust that I would tell you that.

1942
01:35:38,397 --> 01:35:39,731
- Go to hell.
- Take it easy.

1943
01:35:39,732 --> 01:35:42,859
No, you didn't change it so you could
screw those Silicon Valley sluts

1944
01:35:42,860 --> 01:35:44,110
every time you go out to see Mark.

1945
01:35:44,111 --> 01:35:47,238
Not even remotely true, and I can
promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts

1946
01:35:47,239 --> 01:35:50,241
don't care what anyone's
Relationship Status is on Facebook.

1947
01:35:50,242 --> 01:35:51,743
Please, open your present.

1948
01:35:51,744 --> 01:35:54,579
Your phone does work.

1949
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:55,788
It's Mark.

1950
01:35:55,789 --> 01:35:58,041
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.

1951
01:35:58,042 --> 01:36:00,627
Open your present. It's a silk scarf.

1952
01:36:00,628 --> 01:36:02,712
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

1953
01:36:02,713 --> 01:36:04,631
This'll be your first.

1954
01:36:04,632 --> 01:36:05,798
Yeah.

1955
01:36:05,799 --> 01:36:07,133
<i>- You froze our account?
- I</i> did.

1956
01:36:07,134 --> 01:36:09,469
- You froze the account.
- I had to get your attention, Mark.

1957
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:11,304
Do you realise that you jeopardised
the entire company?

1958
01:36:11,305 --> 01:36:12,972
Do you realise that your actions
could have destroyed

1959
01:36:12,973 --> 01:36:14,098
everything I've been working on?

1960
01:36:14,099 --> 01:36:15,225
We have been working on.

1961
01:36:15,226 --> 01:36:16,809
Without money, the site can't function.

1962
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:19,145
Let me tell you the difference
between Facebook and everybody else.

1963
01:36:19,146 --> 01:36:20,313
We don't crash ever!

1964
01:36:20,314 --> 01:36:24,067
If the servers are down for even a day, our
entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed.

1965
01:36:24,068 --> 01:36:26,152
<i>- Look...
- Users are fickle. Friendster has proved that.</i>

1966
01:36:26,153 --> 01:36:28,988
<i>Even a few people leaving would reverberate
through the entire user base.</i>

1967
01:36:28,989 --> 01:36:31,407
The users are interconnected.
That is the whole point.

1968
01:36:31,408 --> 01:36:33,243
College kids are online
because their friends are online

1969
01:36:33,244 --> 01:36:35,495
and if one domino goes,
the other dominos go.

1970
01:36:35,496 --> 01:36:36,663
Don't you get that?

1971
01:36:36,664 --> 01:36:40,291
I am not going back to
the Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!

1972
01:36:40,292 --> 01:36:44,504
Holy shit.

1973
01:36:44,505 --> 01:36:45,964
What is wrong with you?

1974
01:36:45,965 --> 01:36:47,507
Did you like being nobody?

1975
01:36:47,508 --> 01:36:49,342
Did you like being a joke?
Do you wanna go back to that?

1976
01:36:49,343 --> 01:36:50,843
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

1977
01:36:50,844 --> 01:36:52,262
<i>That was the act of a child,
not a businessman,</i>

1978
01:36:52,263 --> 01:36:53,805
<i>and it certainly was not
the act of a friend.</i>

1979
01:36:53,806 --> 01:36:56,432
You know how embarrassing it was for me
to try to cash a cheque today?

1980
01:36:56,433 --> 01:36:57,809
I am not going back to that life.

1981
01:36:57,810 --> 01:37:00,353
<i>- Maybe you were frustrated.</i>
- Yeah!

1982
01:37:00,354 --> 01:37:02,855
- Maybe you were angry.
- I was!

1983
01:37:02,856 --> 01:37:05,316
But I am willing to let bygones be bygones,

1984
01:37:05,317 --> 01:37:07,694
<i>because, Wardo, I've got some good news.</i>

1985
01:37:07,695 --> 01:37:08,945
I'm sorry.

1986
01:37:08,946 --> 01:37:13,825
I was angry, and maybe it was childish,
but I had to get your attention.

1987
01:37:13,826 --> 01:37:17,036
Wardo, I said I've got some good news.

1988
01:37:17,037 --> 01:37:18,162
What is it?

1989
01:37:18,163 --> 01:37:20,790
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment
of half a million dollars.

1990
01:37:20,791 --> 01:37:22,166
What?

1991
01:37:22,167 --> 01:37:26,879
<i>Half a million dollars.
And he's setting us up in an office.</i>

1992
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,507
They wanna reincorporate the company.
They wanna meet you.

1993
01:37:29,508 --> 01:37:31,050
They need your signature
on some documents,

1994
01:37:31,051 --> 01:37:33,553
so you gotta get your ass
on the first flight back to San Francisco.

1995
01:37:33,554 --> 01:37:38,554
<i>I need my CFO.</i>

1996
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:41,227
I'm on my way.

1997
01:37:41,228 --> 01:37:42,895
<i>- Wardo?
- Yeah?</i>

1998
01:37:42,896 --> 01:37:47,692
We did it.

1999
01:37:47,693 --> 01:37:49,485
Wardo?

2000
01:37:49,486 --> 01:37:51,529
You're going back there already?

2001
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:54,407
Yes.

2002
01:37:54,408 --> 01:37:59,408
And also, I'm breaking up with you.

2003
01:38:00,414 --> 01:38:04,709
Somebody stop her!

2004
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:05,877
Four documents.

2005
01:38:05,878 --> 01:38:07,879
The first two are common stock
purchase agreements,

2006
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:11,007
allowing you to buy stock
in the newly reincorporated Facebook,

2007
01:38:11,008 --> 01:38:14,510
as opposed to the old shares,
which are now worthless.

2008
01:38:14,511 --> 01:38:15,762
The third is an exchange agreement

2009
01:38:15,763 --> 01:38:18,598
allowing you to exchange
the old shares for new shares,

2010
01:38:18,599 --> 01:38:20,933
and then finally a voter holding agreement.

2011
01:38:20,934 --> 01:38:22,769
How many shares of stock will I own?

2012
01:38:22,770 --> 01:38:26,022
1,328,334.

2013
01:38:26,023 --> 01:38:27,482
Jesus Christ.

2014
01:38:27,483 --> 01:38:30,902
That represents a 34.4% ownership share.

2015
01:38:30,903 --> 01:38:33,321
Why the increase from the original 30%?

2016
01:38:33,322 --> 01:38:36,783
'Cause you may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.

2017
01:38:36,784 --> 01:38:39,118
- I love working with business majors.
- I'm telling you.

2018
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:40,244
- Economics.
- Right.

2019
01:38:40,245 --> 01:38:45,245
You should know that Mark has already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

2020
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:51,460
Well, Mark doesn't care about money
and he needs to be protected.

2021
01:38:51,757 --> 01:38:54,175
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81 %.

2022
01:38:54,176 --> 01:38:59,176
Sean Parker, 6.47%.

2023
01:38:59,264 --> 01:39:00,390
I can live with that.

2024
01:39:00,391 --> 01:39:05,391
And Peter Thiel, 7%.

2025
01:39:06,605 --> 01:39:09,148
Would you like to use my pen?

2026
01:39:09,149 --> 01:39:13,861
Eduardo? Eduardo?

2027
01:39:13,862 --> 01:39:15,071
Can you please repeat the question?

2028
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:17,365
No, it was an outrageously leading question
the first time around,

2029
01:39:17,366 --> 01:39:18,574
and now you want us to hear it twice?

2030
01:39:18,575 --> 01:39:20,535
Yes. Would you read it back, please?

2031
01:39:20,536 --> 01:39:21,661
Well, go ahead.

2032
01:39:21,662 --> 01:39:23,454
"Counsel: 'And when you signed
these documents,"

2033
01:39:23,455 --> 01:39:26,290
"'were you aware that you were signing
your own death Certificate?”."

2034
01:39:26,291 --> 01:39:26,791
No.

2035
01:39:31,797 --> 01:39:36,008
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyers look over all the...

2036
01:39:36,009 --> 01:39:41,009
In all honesty,
I thought they were my lawyers.

2037
01:39:42,433 --> 01:39:45,935
I was your only friend.

2038
01:39:45,936 --> 01:39:50,936
You had one friend.

2039
01:39:52,109 --> 01:39:53,234
My father won't even look at me.

2040
01:39:53,235 --> 01:39:58,235
Okay, Eduardo, did Mr Zuckerberg say
anything to you after you signed the papers?

2041
01:39:58,449 --> 01:40:02,618
There was a lot of handshaking,
a lot of congratulations.

2042
01:40:02,619 --> 01:40:04,078
He'd already told me that he wouldn't be

2043
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:07,290
coming back to school
for at least a semester,

2044
01:40:07,291 --> 01:40:10,835
so we were saying goodbye for a while.

2045
01:40:10,836 --> 01:40:12,170
And then before I left he said...

2046
01:40:12,171 --> 01:40:13,337
But you gotta come back.

2047
01:40:13,338 --> 01:40:15,923
Somewhere around the end of November
or early December.

2048
01:40:15,924 --> 01:40:18,468
Peter wants to throw us an amazing party
when we hit a million members.

2049
01:40:18,469 --> 01:40:20,303
It's gonna be out of control.
You gotta come back for it.

2050
01:40:20,304 --> 01:40:21,679
A million members?

2051
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:23,347
Yeah.

2052
01:40:23,348 --> 01:40:27,560
Remember the algorithm
on the window at Kirkland?

2053
01:40:27,561 --> 01:40:28,061
Yeah.

2054
01:40:32,191 --> 01:40:37,191
Yeah, I'll be here.

2055
01:40:38,614 --> 01:40:39,864
You sure about this?

2056
01:40:39,865 --> 01:40:41,115
You're 20 minutes late.

2057
01:40:41,116 --> 01:40:42,658
You're gonna walk in there
and say you overslept

2058
01:40:42,659 --> 01:40:43,868
and didn't have time to get dressed.

2059
01:40:43,869 --> 01:40:46,120
They're gonna pitch you.
Case Equity is going to pitch you.

2060
01:40:46,121 --> 01:40:47,788
They're gonna beg you to take their money.

2061
01:40:47,789 --> 01:40:49,540
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod,
you're gonna nod,

2062
01:40:49,541 --> 01:40:52,668
and then you're gonna say,
"Which one of you is Roth?"

2063
01:40:52,669 --> 01:40:54,170
No, not Roth. Manningham.

2064
01:40:54,171 --> 01:40:56,380
"Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?"
And he'll say, "I am."

2065
01:40:56,381 --> 01:41:00,384
And then you say,
"Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you."'

2066
01:41:00,385 --> 01:41:01,844
Walk out.

2067
01:41:01,845 --> 01:41:02,345
<i>Okay-</i>

2068
01:41:15,859 --> 01:41:18,069
In late November, I got
the e-mail from Mark

2069
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:20,196
telling me to come out
for the millionth-member party.

2070
01:41:20,197 --> 01:41:21,822
What else did the e-mail say?

2071
01:41:21,823 --> 01:41:24,867
It said that we had to have
a business meeting.

2072
01:41:24,868 --> 01:41:28,788
That Mark and Sean had played
some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,

2073
01:41:28,789 --> 01:41:30,498
<i>and that Manningham was so impressed</i>

2074
01:41:30,499 --> 01:41:34,502
<i>that he was now making an investment offer
that was hard to turn down.</i>

2075
01:41:34,503 --> 01:41:38,756
<i>So I went to California,
and I went straight to the new offices.</i>

2076
01:41:38,757 --> 01:41:42,552
<i>I didn't know whether to dress for the
party or for the business meeting,</i>

2077
01:41:42,553 --> 01:41:45,638
<i>so I kind of dressed for both.</i>

2078
01:41:45,639 --> 01:41:47,682
<i>- But it didn't matter.
- Why not?</i>

2079
01:41:47,683 --> 01:41:49,976
<i>Because I wasn't called out there
for either one.</i>

2080
01:41:49,977 --> 01:41:54,977
What were you called out there for?

2081
01:41:55,399 --> 01:41:57,191
An ambush.

2082
01:41:57,192 --> 01:42:02,192
Mr Saverin. Hey. Right over here.

2083
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:07,285
Hey, man.

2084
01:42:07,286 --> 01:42:08,411
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

2085
01:42:08,412 --> 01:42:11,205
- Good, good, good, good, good.
- Good to see you.

2086
01:42:11,206 --> 01:42:16,206
At first I thought he was joking.
Giving me more contracts to sign.

2087
01:42:19,047 --> 01:42:24,047
But then I started reading.

2088
01:42:24,219 --> 01:42:26,345
Wait, what is this?

2089
01:42:26,346 --> 01:42:29,724
Well, as you know, we had some
new investors that have come in.

2090
01:42:29,725 --> 01:42:34,725
What is this?

2091
01:42:43,071 --> 01:42:47,158
Mr Saverin.

2092
01:42:47,159 --> 01:42:49,619
Mark!

2093
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:51,162
- Mark?
- He's wired in.

2094
01:42:51,163 --> 01:42:52,288
- Sorry?
- He's wired in.

2095
01:42:52,289 --> 01:42:55,333
- Is he?
- Yes.

2096
01:42:55,334 --> 01:42:58,169
- How about now? Are you still wired in?
- Call security.

2097
01:42:58,170 --> 01:43:01,213
You issued 24 million new shares of stock!

2098
01:43:01,214 --> 01:43:02,923
You were told that if new investors
came along...

2099
01:43:02,924 --> 01:43:06,135
How much were your shares diluted?
How much were his?

2100
01:43:06,136 --> 01:43:10,222
What was Mr Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?

2101
01:43:10,223 --> 01:43:11,349
It wasn't.

2102
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:15,061
What was Mr Moskovitz's ownership share
diluted down to?

2103
01:43:15,062 --> 01:43:16,479
It wasn't.

2104
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,482
What was Sean Parker's ownership share
diluted down to?

2105
01:43:19,483 --> 01:43:20,608
It wasn't.

2106
01:43:20,609 --> 01:43:23,361
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share
diluted down to?

2107
01:43:23,362 --> 01:43:24,528
It wasn't.

2108
01:43:24,529 --> 01:43:28,532
And what was your ownership share
diluted down to?

2109
01:43:28,533 --> 01:43:29,033
.03%

2110
01:43:39,044 --> 01:43:41,420
- You signed the papers.
- You set me up.

2111
01:43:41,421 --> 01:43:44,048
You're gonna blame me because you were
the business head of the company,

2112
01:43:44,049 --> 01:43:46,008
and you made a bad business deal
with your own company?

2113
01:43:46,009 --> 01:43:47,718
It's gonna be like I'm
not a part of Facebook.

2114
01:43:47,719 --> 01:43:49,136
It won't be like
you're not a part of Facebook.

2115
01:43:49,137 --> 01:43:50,262
You're not a part of Facebook.

2116
01:43:50,263 --> 01:43:52,723
- My name's on the masthead.
- You might wanna check again.

2117
01:43:52,724 --> 01:43:54,141
This because I froze the account?

2118
01:43:54,142 --> 01:43:56,394
You think we'd let you
parade around in your ridiculous suits,

2119
01:43:56,395 --> 01:43:57,520
pretending you were running this company?

2120
01:43:57,521 --> 01:43:59,939
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's!

2121
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:04,402
Along with my hoodie and my fuck-you
flip-flops, you pretentious douchebag!

2122
01:44:04,403 --> 01:44:06,153
Security's here. You'll be leaving now.

2123
01:44:06,154 --> 01:44:09,156
- I'm not signing those papers.
- We will get the signature.

2124
01:44:09,157 --> 01:44:13,953
Tell me this isn't about me
getting into the Phoenix.

2125
01:44:13,954 --> 01:44:18,249
You... You did it. I knew you did it.
You planted that story about the chicken!

2126
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:20,459
- I didn't plant that story.
- What's he talking about?

2127
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:23,504
- You had me accused of animal cruelty.
- Seriously. What the hell's the chicken?

2128
01:44:23,505 --> 01:44:25,297
And I'll bet what you hated the most

2129
01:44:25,298 --> 01:44:29,176
is that they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.

2130
01:44:29,177 --> 01:44:32,096
Which I am. You better lawyer up, asshole.

2131
01:44:32,097 --> 01:44:37,097
'Cause I'm not coming back for 30%.
I'm coming back for everything.

2132
01:44:43,108 --> 01:44:48,028
- Get him out of here.
- It's okay, I'm going.

2133
01:44:48,029 --> 01:44:51,532
Hang on.

2134
01:44:51,533 --> 01:44:54,160
Almost forgot.

2135
01:44:54,161 --> 01:44:56,537
Here's your $19,000.
I wouldn't cash it, though.

2136
01:44:56,538 --> 01:45:01,538
I drew it on the account you froze.

2137
01:45:03,378 --> 01:45:07,173
I like standing next to you, Sean.

2138
01:45:07,174 --> 01:45:12,174
It makes me look so tough.

2139
01:45:22,439 --> 01:45:24,190
Well...

2140
01:45:24,191 --> 01:45:27,193
That's it, that's our
show for tonight, people.

2141
01:45:27,194 --> 01:45:29,570
And look, I wanna see everyone here
geared up for a party.

2142
01:45:29,571 --> 01:45:31,739
We're gonna walk into that club
like it's the Macy's Parade.

2143
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:36,740
Mackey, put it up on the big screen.
We've gotta almost be there.

2144
01:45:38,121 --> 01:45:41,248
- You all right?
- Yeah.

2145
01:45:41,249 --> 01:45:42,792
You were kind of rough on him.

2146
01:45:42,793 --> 01:45:45,002
That's life in the NFL.

2147
01:45:45,003 --> 01:45:46,712
You know you didn't have to be
that rough on him.

2148
01:45:46,713 --> 01:45:50,174
- Listen, I put him...
- Sean!

2149
01:45:50,175 --> 01:45:52,343
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

2150
01:45:52,344 --> 01:45:56,305
He almost killed it.

2151
01:45:56,306 --> 01:45:59,225
I'll send flowers.

2152
01:45:59,226 --> 01:46:04,021
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together
a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

2153
01:46:04,022 --> 01:46:05,356
Ashleigh's a sister.

2154
01:46:05,357 --> 01:46:06,982
- Ashleigh?
- The intern.

2155
01:46:06,983 --> 01:46:10,778
Yeah. I know who she is. Are you guys...

2156
01:46:10,779 --> 01:46:12,530
Ashleigh? Me? No.

2157
01:46:12,531 --> 01:46:14,865
Well, a little bit.

2158
01:46:14,866 --> 01:46:15,991
Why?

2159
01:46:15,992 --> 01:46:17,910
- No. Nothing, I just...
- Excuse me. Mark?

2160
01:46:17,911 --> 01:46:21,831
- We were just talking about you.
- Just that you're doing a really good job.

2161
01:46:21,832 --> 01:46:25,000
Thanks. I appreciate that.

2162
01:46:25,001 --> 01:46:26,168
These came in for you.

2163
01:46:26,169 --> 01:46:31,169
Put them on my desk.

2164
01:46:34,928 --> 01:46:37,221
What's the package?

2165
01:46:37,222 --> 01:46:40,683
Nothing.

2166
01:46:40,684 --> 01:46:42,268
- Mackey.
- Yes, sir.

2167
01:46:42,269 --> 01:46:44,061
Refresh.

2168
01:46:44,062 --> 01:46:44,562
Sweet!

2169
01:46:51,278 --> 01:46:53,612
And you're not a hugger.

2170
01:46:53,613 --> 01:46:57,533
I know.

2171
01:46:57,534 --> 01:47:00,578
One million!

2172
01:47:00,579 --> 01:47:04,665
Who's got champagne? Huh?

2173
01:47:04,666 --> 01:47:09,666
I've got champagne.

2174
01:47:26,313 --> 01:47:29,982
The next transformative development,
a picture-sharing application.

2175
01:47:29,983 --> 01:47:33,152
A place where you view pictures
that coincide with your social life.

2176
01:47:33,153 --> 01:47:36,238
It is the true digitalisation of real life.

2177
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:38,782
- You can use a CD.
- You can do it off of me.

2178
01:47:38,783 --> 01:47:40,576
You don't just go to a party any more.

2179
01:47:40,577 --> 01:47:44,413
You go to a party with a digital camera, and
then your friends relive the party online.

2180
01:47:44,414 --> 01:47:45,873
And tagging. The idea...

2181
01:47:45,874 --> 01:47:50,874
- Would this be easier without the bra?
- It's worth finding out.

2182
01:47:56,843 --> 01:47:59,595
All right, shut the music down!

2183
01:47:59,596 --> 01:48:01,305
The party's over!

2184
01:48:01,306 --> 01:48:03,599
Everybody, go home!

2185
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:06,143
I've spent hours watching
what people do when they log on.

2186
01:48:06,144 --> 01:48:07,603
How they check their
friends' status updates.

2187
01:48:07,604 --> 01:48:09,188
Wait. That's weird. Why did the music stop?

2188
01:48:09,189 --> 01:48:10,439
Check to see which one of their friends

2189
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,441
changed their profiles,
changed their photos...

2190
01:48:12,442 --> 01:48:14,109
Seriously, what happened to the music?

2191
01:48:14,110 --> 01:48:16,153
We lived on farms
and then we lived in cities,

2192
01:48:16,154 --> 01:48:18,197
and now we're going to
live on the Internet!

2193
01:48:18,198 --> 01:48:23,198
Sean, stop.
I think something's going on downstairs.

2194
01:48:30,919 --> 01:48:33,796
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

2195
01:48:33,797 --> 01:48:37,383
It's time for you to go home.
The party is over.

2196
01:48:37,384 --> 01:48:40,970
Then it's all good.

2197
01:48:40,971 --> 01:48:42,137
- It's the cops.
- What?

2198
01:48:42,138 --> 01:48:43,263
Shit! Shit.

2199
01:48:43,264 --> 01:48:47,559
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Okay, it's okay. Be cool.

2200
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:50,938
Good to see you, Officer.
What can I do for you?

2201
01:48:50,939 --> 01:48:52,064
What's going on?

2202
01:48:52,065 --> 01:48:54,733
Was the music too loud?
We were having a celebration.

2203
01:48:54,734 --> 01:48:56,360
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.

2204
01:48:56,361 --> 01:49:01,361
I can tell them to turn the music down.

2205
01:49:03,076 --> 01:49:04,535
That's not mine.

2206
01:49:04,536 --> 01:49:07,621
Okay, we're gonna need identification.
Keep your hands where we can see them.

2207
01:49:07,622 --> 01:49:09,123
Oh, my God.

2208
01:49:09,124 --> 01:49:10,916
You got anything else in your pockets
I should know about?

2209
01:49:10,917 --> 01:49:12,042
No, sir. No.

2210
01:49:12,043 --> 01:49:17,043
- Don't be stupid, now.
- I don't, I don't.

2211
01:49:19,384 --> 01:49:21,093
What's this?

2212
01:49:21,094 --> 01:49:23,887
That's an EpiPen.

2213
01:49:23,888 --> 01:49:27,057
- And this?
- That's my inhaler.

2214
01:49:27,058 --> 01:49:29,309
How old are you?

2215
01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:31,186
Twenty-one.

2216
01:49:31,187 --> 01:49:32,312
Twenty-one.

2217
01:49:32,313 --> 01:49:33,814
- Twenty-one.
- I'm 21.

2218
01:49:33,815 --> 01:49:36,859
Lying only makes it worse.

2219
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:41,860
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

2220
01:49:50,373 --> 01:49:51,498
Hello.

2221
01:49:51,499 --> 01:49:56,499
Listen, something's happened.

2222
01:50:01,301 --> 01:50:02,426
Shit.

2223
01:50:02,427 --> 01:50:04,428
No, it's all right. It's
gonna be all right.

2224
01:50:04,429 --> 01:50:09,429
I posted bond, and Iwasn't doing anything.
I mean, I've got allergies.

2225
01:50:13,229 --> 01:50:14,354
Interns.

2226
01:50:14,355 --> 01:50:18,984
It was just a party.

2227
01:50:18,985 --> 01:50:23,572
This is gonna be news, Sean.
It's gonna be online any second.

2228
01:50:23,573 --> 01:50:24,698
I know.

2229
01:50:24,699 --> 01:50:26,450
You know with an intern...

2230
01:50:26,451 --> 01:50:28,702
No, it's cool. I have it under control.

2231
01:50:28,703 --> 01:50:30,412
I will get it under control.

2232
01:50:30,413 --> 01:50:32,831
I will call someone
and see what the next move is.

2233
01:50:32,832 --> 01:50:35,125
But this is gonna be news now.

2234
01:50:35,126 --> 01:50:37,711
You don't think Wardo
was involved, do you?

2235
01:50:37,712 --> 01:50:38,837
I mean, do you think...

2236
01:50:38,838 --> 01:50:40,130
No.

2237
01:50:40,131 --> 01:50:42,091
Or Manningham. One of them.

2238
01:50:42,092 --> 01:50:45,427
Somebody. Somebody sent the coke
in there, because it got in there.

2239
01:50:45,428 --> 01:50:50,428
You believe me. God, this is gonna be fine.

2240
01:50:52,102 --> 01:50:56,063
Right?

2241
01:50:56,064 --> 01:51:01,064
Go home, Sean.

2242
01:51:12,872 --> 01:51:15,958
<i>Mark?</i>

2243
01:51:15,959 --> 01:51:19,545
<i>Mark.</i>

2244
01:51:19,546 --> 01:51:21,296
We're done for the day.

2245
01:51:21,297 --> 01:51:26,297
Yeah. Yeah, I was just sitting here.

2246
01:51:27,554 --> 01:51:29,805
What happened to Sean?

2247
01:51:29,806 --> 01:51:34,806
He still owns 7% of the company.

2248
01:51:36,396 --> 01:51:40,732
All you had all day was that salad.
Do you wanna get something to eat?

2249
01:51:40,733 --> 01:51:41,277
I can't.

2250
01:51:49,742 --> 01:51:51,076
I'm not a bad guy.

2251
01:51:51,077 --> 01:51:52,953
I know that.

2252
01:51:52,954 --> 01:51:56,582
When there's emotional testimony,
I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.

2253
01:51:56,583 --> 01:51:58,125
And the other 15?

2254
01:51:58,126 --> 01:52:03,126
Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.

2255
01:52:04,924 --> 01:52:07,426
What happens now?

2256
01:52:07,427 --> 01:52:12,139
Sy and the others are having a steak
on University Avenue.

2257
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:13,682
Then they'll come back up to the office,

2258
01:52:13,683 --> 01:52:17,102
and start working on a settlement
agreement to present to you.

2259
01:52:17,103 --> 01:52:19,605
- They're gonna settle?
- Oh, yeah.

2260
01:52:19,606 --> 01:52:22,524
- And you're gonna have to pay a little extra.
- Why?

2261
01:52:22,525 --> 01:52:24,776
So that these guys sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

2262
01:52:24,777 --> 01:52:27,863
They say one unflattering word about you
in public, you own their wife and kids.

2263
01:52:27,864 --> 01:52:29,156
I invented Facebook.

2264
01:52:29,157 --> 01:52:31,533
I'm talking about a jury.

2265
01:52:31,534 --> 01:52:34,203
I specialise in voir dire, jury selection.

2266
01:52:34,204 --> 01:52:36,663
What a jury sees
when they look at a defendant.

2267
01:52:36,664 --> 01:52:39,124
Clothes, hair, speaking
style, likeability...

2268
01:52:39,125 --> 01:52:40,459
Likeability.

2269
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:43,378
I've been licensed to practise law
for all of 20 months,

2270
01:52:43,379 --> 01:52:44,838
and I could get a jury to believe

2271
01:52:44,839 --> 01:52:47,633
that you planted the story
about Eduardo and the chicken.

2272
01:52:47,634 --> 01:52:49,218
Watch what else.

2273
01:52:49,219 --> 01:52:52,054
Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party
that night?

2274
01:52:52,055 --> 01:52:54,348
- You think I'm the one that called the police?
- Doesn't matter.

2275
01:52:54,349 --> 01:52:56,516
I asked the question,
now everybody's thinking about it.

2276
01:52:56,517 --> 01:53:00,312
You've lost your jury in
the first 10 minutes.

2277
01:53:00,313 --> 01:53:01,521
Farm animals.

2278
01:53:01,522 --> 01:53:03,690
Yeah.

2279
01:53:03,691 --> 01:53:06,318
I was drunk and angry and stupid.

2280
01:53:06,319 --> 01:53:09,696
- And blogging-
- And blogging-

2281
01:53:09,697 --> 01:53:11,323
Pay them.

2282
01:53:11,324 --> 01:53:12,991
In the scheme of things,

2283
01:53:12,992 --> 01:53:16,328
it's a speeding ticket.

2284
01:53:16,329 --> 01:53:18,830
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.

2285
01:53:18,831 --> 01:53:21,833
Do you think anybody would mind if I stayed
and used the computer for a minute?

2286
01:53:21,834 --> 01:53:23,418
I can't imagine it would be a problem.

2287
01:53:23,419 --> 01:53:25,504
Thanks.

2288
01:53:25,505 --> 01:53:30,505
I appreciate your help today.

2289
01:53:31,678 --> 01:53:35,180
You're not an asshole, Mark.

2290
01:53:35,181 --> 01:53:40,181
You're just trying so hard to be.
